But after some good domestic results he found a place on the 2010 England tour as Kamran Akmal's understudy, and when the senior keeper's lapses became too frequent, Haider was given a Test debut at Edgbaston. He was out to his first ball feathering a catch behind, but his characterful and determined 88 in the second innings formed the basis of a fightback.  \n"", 'That innings was testament to his character as his road to the top has been made in difficult personal circumstances. He took part in the Under-15 World Cup in England in the summer of 2000 at the age of 13. Four years later, at the Under-19 World Cup in Dhaka, he scored a vital 23 not out from 18 balls, and claimed three catches, as Pakistan took the title in the final against West Indies. ', 'A broken finger after his Test debut ruled him out for the remainder of the tour and then his career appeared to come to an extraordinary, and worrying, end when he fled the one-day series against South Africa in UAE for London claiming he had received death threats following the fourth ODI.

He was selected for the U-15 world championship in West Indies in 2008 and picked up 10 wickets at 17.10. He was also part of two back-to-back Under-19 World Cups from 2012 but he shot to the limelight during a Youth tour to England in 2013. He finished as the most successful bowler, in a tri-series also involving Bangladesh, with 18 wickets at 11.44.\n \nHe continued to make inroads back home as well, moving smoothly from Under-15 to Under-19 and then finally won a domestic contract with Zarat Taraqiati Bank Limited, one of the largest departmental teams. He captained the ZTBL U-19 team and was later given an opportunity to play in the senior team and rubbed shoulders with the likes of Saeed Ajmal, Abdul Razzaq, Yasir Hameed. Then he moved to play for State Bank of Pakistan and in 2015 Sui Southern Gas Corporation roped him for the entire season.\n \n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,0,15,15,15,15,100,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,41,5,625,76,17.36,1392,44.89,0,3,61,9,14.0,0.0,50.0,38,6,334,25,10.43,447,74.72,0,0,20,8,10.0,0.0,40.0,19,6,156,30,12,129,120.93,0,0,6,10,10.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,60,54,2,Feb-54,Feb-54,27,5.4,30,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28.0,47,6038,2717,106,Jun-80,10/140,25.63,2.69,56.9,4,5,1,50.0,50,2494,2052,76,May-56,May-56,27,4.93,32.8,2,1,0,40.0,38,791,957,50,Apr-14,Apr-14,19.14,7.25,15.8,3,0,0

Sporadic comparisons with Australia's Adam Gilchrist were understandable - both were left-handed wicketkeeper-batsmen capable of savaging an attack - and while nobody, not least himself, ever claimed he would reach the same heights, at his best he had a simple eye for destruction and was always eminently watchable. He was also more resilient than might have been imagined for such a socially relaxed individual: nobody had played more first-class games for Durham until Paul Collingwood overtook him. \n"", ""Mustard, a former England U-19, enjoyed a superb 2007 as Durham won their first two trophies, scoring 893 List A runs at 49.61, including a breezy 49 in the county's first Lord's final. Off the back of such a successful summer, he was called up to replace the injured Matt Prior for England's one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007. And although he kept beautifully, his highest score opening the batting was 28. He was still named as back-up keeper to Prior for the subsequent Test series in Sri Lanka and again acted as understudy during the New Zealand Tests, this time to Tim Ambrose. In the ODI series that followed Mustard returned to the side and finally made his mark with 83 from 74 balls in a dramatic tied game in Napier. But one half-century was not enough to retain his place for that summer's ODIs as Ambrose kept against New Zealand and Prior returned for the South Africa series."", 'The subsequent emergence of Craig Kieswetter, followed by many others, put an end to his England hopes but domestically, Mustard continued to perform in domestic one-day cricket with distinction. In first-class cricket, Mustard did not produce the consistent performances he managed in the limited-overs formats', 'Captaincy had rarely been on his mind, but Durham turned to him early in the 2010 season when Will Smith, a good tactician whose authority was undermined by slim personal returns with the bat, was persuaded to resign during a coach journey north from a heavy defeat at Trent Bridge. Mustard, known universally as The Colonel after the character in the Cluedo board game, averaged close to 40 again and more importantly steadied the ship as Durham finished fifth in the County Championship.', '2011 was his first full year as four-day captain (Dale Benkenstein took over the one-day role) and Mustard enjoyed a fine campaign, scoring 716 runs at 51.14 as Durham looked strong favourites for a third title in four seasons. But, coupled with a turn in the north-eastern weather, their challenge faded towards the end of the season as Twenty20 quarter-final and CB40 semi-final defeats added to the disappointment.', ""And the poor form ran into 2012 as Durham endured a disastrous first-half to the season and, rooted to the bottom of the table, Paul Collingwood took over as captain. He conjured a miraculous recovery that led Durham to the safety of mid-table but Mustard returned the second-worst figures of his career with 482 runs at just 21.90 with one half-century. He was more like his old self as Durham won the title the following summer and even took his first first-class wicket in a lighthearted finish to the season when he trapped the England one-day batsman, Luke Wright, lbw with a quicker-slower one. When his form declined markedly in 2015, he briefly answered Lancashire's urgent need for a keeper with a short loan deal. Gloucestershire also enticed him on loan in 2016 and, as Durham signalled that he would be released, successfully offered him a two-year deal at the end of the season. When Gareth Roderick missed the start of 2017 because of illness, much to his surprise he even found hmself captain again."", 'Mustard also played Twenty20 cricket abroad in the off season. He represented Barisal Burners in the Bangladesh Premier League and Mountaineers in Zimbabwe in the 2011-12 season, scoring 56 in the final to help the latter win their domestic title. He had hoped to play in the Pakistan Premier League, but Durham refused to endorse a No Objections Certificate amid concerns over security.', 'A talented all-round sportsman, Mustard was at Manchester United for two years until he was 13 and then with Middlesbrough until he was 15.

What he observed - not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side - convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary in England's cricket with a policy of No Fear (and No Retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion a side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism. \n"", 'The revival he led was dramatic. Going into the 2019 World Cup year, England were rated not only the No. 1 ODI side but had set a host of new records, including the two highest scores made in the format. Morgan, relentlessly committed to this bold style of play on good days and bad, was at the heart of the transformation.', ""Morgan's self-sufficiency and independent thought has caused him to tread a path that has not always been popular with English administrators. He preferred the IPL to county cricket long before it was ECB policy. Although he strove for a while to play for England in all three formats, he played the last of his 16 Tests in 2012 and his interest in the longer format appeared to wane once he recognised he had little chance of a recall. He didn't play any first-class cricket in 2016 or 2017 and averaged 11 when he returned for half-a-dozen games in 2018. A somewhat private man, he is respected by his players for his inner strength, cool temperament and tactical nous but remains largely a closed book to those outside the dressing room."", 'Once the selectors had decided to dispense with Alastair Cook just before Christmas in 2014, Morgan, the regular ODI deputy, was the most obvious candidate.  But his elevation coincided with one of his worst periods of form since switching to England from Ireland. A left-hander who quickly built a reputation for inventive and audacious strokeplay, Morgan also possessed the patience and power of shot to be a natural ""finisher"" - a role England had struggled to fill for a decade. In some ways, he was a prototype, encouraging the English game to adopt a more inventive approach only subsequently to face up to the challenge that he might be overtaken by more highly-powered models.', 'As a young man in Dublin, Morgan was recognised as a cricketer of rare unorthodox talent, who plays the ball exceptionally late and was adroit both at sweeping and reverse sweeping. Time at Dulwich College only hardened his desire to play for England, which he never tried to hide back in Ireland.', ""Morgan made his Ireland debut at the age of 16, making 99 against Scotland in Ayr, and was soon signed by Middlesex, who gave him his debut a week after his 19th birthday. He floundered in the 2007 World Cup: batting at No. 3, he made only 91 runs in nine games. But he soon established himself in the Middlesex line up, especially in limited overs cricket, and his switch to England was long anticipated. After securing Ireland's qualification for the 2011 World Cup, in April 2009, he was called up by England, thereby denying Ireland the chances to pick him in the World T20 and beyond."", ""At the age of 23, he shot to prominence on the back of two match-winning innings against South Africa. First was a 34-ball 67 in the Champions Trophy in September 2009, followed two months later with an unbeaten 45-ball 85 in the opening Twenty20 of England's tour of South Africa. His bold approach and crisp hitting evoked comparisons with Kevin Pietersen."", 'His growing stature was confirmed when he was the only England player to be awarded a new contract at the auction for the third season of the IPL in January 2010. He was signed for $220,000 by Bangalore, where he joined England team-mate Pietersen. But he failed to make an impression and was soon left on the bench. He returned to his best for England in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean as his powerful shot-making and coolness under pressure helped England to their first triumph in global limited-overs events. With three ODI hundreds that year, his first for England coming against Bangladesh in Dhaka, his reputation was soaring.', ""Despite a modest first-class record he was rewarded with a surprise call-up to the Test side for England's first Test of the 2010 summer, against Bangladesh. Walking out to bat at 258 for 4, he could not have asked for a gentler introduction and showed enough confidence to pick up his first Test boundary with a reverse-sweep. With the retirement of Paul Collingwood, a permanent space opened up in England's Test side. Centuries against Pakistan (2010) and India (2011) represented the high points."", 'But a disastrous tour of the UAE in early 2012 effectively ended his Test career. With Joe Root making his debut before the end of the year, he never returned to the Test side.', ""He remained an indispensable member of the one-day side, though. And while there were prolonged fallow periods - from September 2012, for example, he went a year and 17 innings without an ODI half-century and, by the time he was appointed captain, he had scored one fifty in 19 innings - he produced enough outstanding innings (not least a match-defining century against Ireland) to retain his place. Going into the 2019 World Cup, he was England's record run-scorer in ODIs."", 'While his captaincy record at domestic level was not inspiring - Middlesex won five out of 22 limited-overs matches under him in 2014 - and the 2015 World Cup campaign was painfully poor, progress was fast once England embraced a new coaching regime (Peter Moores was sacked in May 2015) and bolder selections. A watershed series against New Zealand saw England, so hesitant and mediocre at the World Cup, pass 350 three times in 10 days in registering their highest ever ODI total (408-9; subsequently overtaken) and their highest ever second-innings total (365-9; also subsequently overtaken). A new template had been set.', ""Such was Morgan's statute within the side, he survived his decision to skip the Bangladesh tour in 2016 on security grounds - the players had been given a choice whether to tour, though the impression remained the management had rather hoped the captain would lead the way - and oversaw a spell of 12 bi-lateral series wins out of 13, including nine in a row broken only by an aberrational defeat against Scotland. If highlights were a 4-1 victory in Australia in early 2018 and a 5-0 whitewash at home later in the year, it was all a prelude to the 2019 World Cup which will surely define both his and his side's legacy.\n"", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003, 2004']",16.0,24,1,700,130,30.43,1278,54.77,2,3,77,6,11.0,0.0,217.0,203,29,6813,124*,39.15,7592,89.73,12,43,575,182,77.0,0.0,80.0,78,15,1753,85*,27.82,1347,130.14,0,9,131,78,35.0,0.0,99.0,164,16,4912,209*,33.18,9649,50.9,11,23,,,75.0,1.0,345.0,319,44,10667,161,38.78,11850,90.01,20,64,,,116.0,0.0,267.0,253,34,5595,90,25.54,4378,127.79,0,28,436,238,126.0,0.0,16.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,217.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,80.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,99.0,,102,90,2,Feb-24,Feb-24,45,5.29,51,0,0,0,345.0,,42,49,0,-,-,-,7,-,0,0,0,267.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

His mother was running the program in the area and Zondo was among her charges.  \n"", ""\nHe honed his skills at Westville Boys High and joined a Premier League club Pinetown at the age of 15. Zondo was part of Kwa-Zulu Natal's age-group provincial sides at under-13, u-15, u-17 and u-19 level and was just 17 years old when he made his first-class debut for Kwa-Zulu Natal's provincial side in November 2007. Two months later, he debuted for Dolphins, Durban's franchise team. "", '\nHe bounced between the provincial side and the franchise team, where he found it difficult to hold down a spot. In the 2011-12 season, Zondo was picked to be part of a seventh domestic franchise, Impi, a team made up of players like him who were on the fringes of teams and competed in the domestic T20 competition.

Zondo's 154 runs at 38.50 in four matches earned him a maiden international call-up for South Africa's tour to India in October 2015, where he was named in the T20 squad as a replacement for the injured Rilee Rossouw.

Lumb's confident strokeplay was not short of swagger and was just what England needed at the top of the order as they sought to bring more vigour to their short-form game. No respecter of tradition, he was also one of the first England cricketers to make unabashed calls for the ECB to introduce a city-based Twenty20 tournament.  \n"", ""Lumb, the son of prolific Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb, was born in South Africa and made his way through the junior teams in Transvaal before returning to his roots to play for Yorkshire. A hard-hitting batsman, he made his county debut in 2000, scoring 66 not out against the touring Zimbabweans. A knee injury in 2001 meant that he played only a small part in Yorkshire's success in winning the county championship that year, although he did record a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire. In doing so he became part of only the fourth father and son pair to score centuries for Yorkshire."", ""He made progress in 2002 by becoming a regular member of both the Championship and limited-overs sides and in 2003 scored close to a thousand first-class runs at an average of over 40, including two centuries and six fifties. He was selected for the ECB National Academy squad the following winter, but has failed to progress to Yorkshire's expectations and was dropped during the 2005 season.  Although he averaged in the middle-thirties in 2006 with a top score of 144 he decided to leave at the end of the season and joined Hampshire."", 'The move galvanised his career, and his prolific Twenty20 form in 2009, where he made 442 runs from 11 games as Hampshire won the Friends Provident Trophy, including a blistering unbeaten 124 from 69 balls against Essex, earned him a $50,000 IPL contract with Rajasthan Royals.  It proved to be the launch-pad to higher achievements.', ""On the back of an unbeaten 58 to guide England Lions to victory against the senior team in a warm-up match in Dubai, he was called in as the latest incarnation of England's Twenty20 specialist opener for the World Twenty20 in Caribbean in May 2010. His selection was a revelation as, despite a top score of 33, he routinely muscled brisk starts which set the tone that carried England to their first ever triumph in a global limited-overs event."", ""Injury disrupted his 2011 season, the final year of his contract  with Hampshire, but he was identified by Nottinghamshire as batsman who could bolster an unreliable top order in four-day cricket and director of cricket Mick Newell, who remembered Lumb's career-best Championship score of 219 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 2010, signed him on a three-year contract. "", 'His debut season for Nottinghamshire yielded more than 1,400 runs across all formats, including 910 in the Championship.  Although he did not make the starting XI in any of their matches, Lumb regained his place in the England Twenty20 squad in time for the defence of the World Twenty20 before playing a starring role for Sydney Sixers in the Champions League in South Africa, hitting an unbeaten 82 off 42 balls as the Australian franchise beat Lions by 10 wickets in the final.', 'Suspicions that Lumb might increasingly become a T20 specialist were confounded in 2013 when he returned more than 1,000 Championship runs. He skipped the IPL auction in 2014, saying he had ""ticked that box"" but England - and Sydney - retained an interest in his T20 skills and he was named in England\'s squad for World T20 in Bangladesh.', 'Lumb teamed up with Riki Wessels in 2016 to set what was a new record stand for a List A game in England: 342 in 39.2 overs in a Royal London Cup game against Northants at Trent Bridge, beating the 318 amassed by India\'s Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly against Sri Lanka in Taunton in the 1999 World Cup. Lumb, who made 184, commented that it was one of those days ""when the stars were all aligned"". Nottinghamshire\'s 445 for 8 in their 50 overs was the second highest total in List A matches worldwide at the time. Astonishingly, despite being stricken by injuries, Northants got within 20 runs. Lumb also hit the mark with a 17-ball T20 50 against Leicestershire, one of the fastest in Notts\' history, but his poor Championship form had much in keeping with a Notts relegation season.', ""Lumb's final summer came in Notts' triumphant 2017 season when they added promotion in the Championship to both limited-overs trophies.

One is a flamboyant left-handed opener for England's one-day side, who exploits fielding restrictions in the first 15 overs by slapping the ball over mid-on and carving it through point. The other is a tentative Test player, fallible outside off stump and to the straight, full-length delivery when he plays round his front pad and falls away to the off side. His two best Test innings (113 v Pakistan, Headingley in 1996, and 96 in the flippin'-murdered-'em draw v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 1996-97) seemed to set him up, but he was dropped after a poor series in New Zealand that winter, and has won only five more caps, four of them in 2000. Knight was harshly left out of the World Cup team in 1999, but seemed set to make amends in 2003 after several impressive displays in the VB Series, which led seasoned Australian observers to wonder why on earth he wasn't a Test regular.  But after England's failure in the World Cup, he called time on his international one-day career - but not Tests - to enable him to concentrate on leading Warwickshire.  Knight, who began his career at Essex but moved to Warwickshire in 1995, is a world-class fielder - whether at third slip, in the gully, at short midwicket or as a cover sweeper - and an outgoing, hard-to-suppress team man.

Injuries then took their toll, leaving him with a challenging task just to keep his county career on track, but always with the knowledge that England's interest had never entirely waned. \n"", 'Meaker\'s succession of injuries, some of which needs surgery, was so bad that he felt he was ""bordering on the yips"". He was unsure whether injuries had curtailed his speed and effectiveness or whether his technique and confidence had simply deteriorated. He became prone to great inconsistency from one day to the next. didn\'t know what was going to happen. It was a very bad place for me. Although a long way from England contention, Meaker reanalysed his action with the help of Kevin Shine, England\'s fast bowling coach, at the national performance centre in Loughborough and England Lions came calling again in 2016 after a solid Championship season for Surrey which brought him 37 wickets at 31.', ""Pietermaritzburg-born and raised before his family moved to England in 2001, and a graduate of Cranleigh School, in 2003 he won the Telegraph fast bowling award, the Channel 4 outstanding team player award and the AA Thompson fielding award. He finished his school career by winning the EW Swanton cricket prize and within a fortnight of leaving he received an England Under-19s call-up, having played some pre-season friendlies for Surrey. He made his Surrey debut as a 19-year-old in 2008 and had a spell in grade cricket that winter in Sydney, returning in 2009 with better accuracy to join his pace. Meaker was also the first recipient of the ECB's Harold Larwood Fast Bowling Scholarship to Australia and despite struggling, with the rest of his team-mates, in 2010 made an excellent start to the 2011 season. His efforts bore fruit when he made his debut for England Lions against Sri Lanka A that summer and he was then capped twice by England in the ODI series in India at the end of the season."", 'In 2011, Meaker took 44 Championship wickets at 22.56; a year later, he returned identical figures. Still below his mid-20s, it was compelling stuff. ""I was flying: swinging the ball both ways, knocking people\'s poles over for fun and thinking this is fantastic, I\'m the new Allan Donald,"" he said. He continued to interest England, playing in two T20s at the end of another India tour in 2012. But his progress was undermined by repeated injuries and, on the rare occasions he was fit, a tendency to bowl too many four balls striving for extra pace.', 'A knee operation at the end of the 2013 season scuppered his chances of an Ashes series in Australia. On other occasions, his injuries just made him seem unfortunate. He was struck in the groin in pre-season nets in 2016 and realised that he was not wearing a box. He needed an emergency operation and by the time he returned for Surrey he felt that, at 27, even his county career could not be entirely guaranteed, but recovered form enough to fire up his ambitions yet again of a bright future. His captain, Gareth Batty, told him just to run in and bowl fast, and the hope was that the swing and consistency that had also characterised him at his peak would return.', '\n', '\n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2,0,2,1,1,16,12.5,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,2.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,1.0,0.0,89.0,117,24,1445,94,15.53,3860,37.43,0,6,187,3,20.0,0.0,69.0,34,18,115,21*,7.18,221,52.03,0,0,7,0,19.0,0.0,32.0,11,6,46,17,9.2,38,121.05,0,0,5,1,13.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2,114,110,2,Jan-45,Jan-45,55,5.78,57,0,0,0,2.0,2,47,70,2,Jan-28,Jan-28,35,8.93,23.5,0,0,0,89.0,148,13762,8701,279,Aug-52,11/167,31.18,3.79,49.3,16,11,2,69.0,63,2565,2635,75,Apr-37,Apr-37,35.13,6.16,34.2,4,0,0,32.0,30,519,774,26,Apr-30,Apr-30,29.76,8.94,19.9,1,0,0

He promised to - and almost did - reach the top; but remained calmly cheerful and humorous despite his setbacks.

He joined Somerset when he was 18 and made his international debut four years later, little more than a week after qualifying for England. He was briefly England\'s answer at the top of the order, helping them win the 2010 World Twenty20 and rise up the one-day rankings. But his form stuttered and he was dropped after the India tour in January 2013. He returned to the squad at the 2014 World T20 but failed to add to his 46 one-day internationals and 25 T20Is. During the subsequent English season, he suffered a sickening blow in the face, breaking his nose and damaging his eye socket while batting against Northants when a delivery from David Willey burst through his grille. It forced him into retirement in June 2015 as he conceded defeat to impaired vision and what he indicated was psychological trauma. ""I feel I will never be mentally the player I was,"" he said. \n', 'He played for South Africa at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup before coming to Millfield School. He made his Somerset first-team debut in April 2007, scoring 69 not out off 58 balls and taking a catch his coach described as ""world class"". The batsmen-friendly conditions at Taunton aided his attacking instincts and in the 2009 English season, his last before he qualified, he scored 1,242 runs at a 59.14 in the County Championship as well as averaging almost 50 in one-day cricket.', 'The selectors, who had been watching for some time, rewarded him with a place on the Lions tour of UAE although Geoff Miller did caution that England ""had to be careful about the number of South Africans in the side"". Yet Kieswetter was undeterred and repeated his allegiance to England when Graeme Smith said he\'d like to him to come back to South Africa.', ""The day after he became eligible for England in February 2010 he hit 81 against the senior side in Abu Dhabi, enough to earn a rapid elevation to the full squad for Bangladesh where his first innings of the tour was the small matter of 143. It was a promising sign. He made a century in his third ODI, against Bangladesh before playing a crucial role in delivering England's first ever global limited-overs success in the World Twenty20. Alongside Michael Lumb, Kieswetter powered England to aggressive starts, making 222 runs in the tournament, the fourth-highest tally, including a Man-of-the-Match winning 63 in the final against Australia."", 'But that proved his high water mark. In his next 18 T20s for England, Kieswetter made only two half-centuries and was eventually dropped for the crucial World T20 tie against Sri Lanka in 2012. Jos Buttler, his county team-mate, took his place and Buttler eventually usurped him from the ODI side too.', 'In 2013, a battle ensued between Kieswetter and Buttler for the gloves at Somerset but Kieswetter did enough to earn the No. 1 slot with over 500 runs in the Friends Life t20 - form that earned him a deal in the Australian Big Bash League - an average of 56.80 in the Yorkshire Bank 40 and 31.89 in first-class cricket. Buttler left for Lancashire at the end of the season.', ""Kieswetter initially thrived in the ODI side, averaging 51.00 in the five-match series at home to Sri Lanka in 2011 but in his next 23 innings made only two half-centuries. Struggling in India could be forgiven and he didn't get too many chances in subsequent series that England dominated against Pakistan and Australia as he was moved down the order. But with his wicketkeeping not the sharpest, the calls for change grew after a top score of 33 in four innings against South Africa. He went back to India in January 2013 but was dropped for the final two ODIs and was then left out of the tour to New Zealand under new one-day coach Ashley Giles."", 'He had initially hoped to fully recover from his injury, sustained when struck by a short delivery from Willey. He returned at the end of 2015 season and then went to play domestic T20 in South Africa, but struggled with the after-effects of the injury and announced he would not be playing the 2015 English season.', '""I realise I am one of those lucky people who earns a living doing something they truly love,"" he said.

After being awarded a benefit year by his club in 2007, he was given his chance to shine for England when called up to their one-day squad in June. It was a long overdue selection as Hampshire supporters will attest to, but Mascarenhas made his chance count, slapping five sixes in a single over from Yuvraj Singh at The Oval, and earning a call-up to England's Twenty20 squad on the back of some disciplined bowling performances. His growing reputation in the shorter forms of the game saw him as the first England player to join the Indian Premier League, in 2009, and later that year he captained Hampshire to a Friends Provident Trophy triumph at Lord's, where Sussex were beaten in the final."", 'It was at the IPL, in 2010, however, that Mascarenhas suffered a serious Achilles injury that meant he bowled just three overs for Hampshire in the season and eventually needed surgery.

He made his Test debut the same summer, against West Indies. He toured South Africa later that year, taking 4 for 60 in the third Test at Durban. Martin played in all of England's games in the 1996 World Cup , but despite bowling well, he didn't pick up many wickets. He played his last one-dayer in England colours against South Africa in the ICC knock-out competition in 1998.

His path into the England team was blocked by Jack Russell and especially Alec Stewart as the team tried to find an allrounder. Nixon's one taste of the top level came when he was Stewart's understudy on the 2000-01 tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. However, despite his lack of chances to prove himself with England he has been a fine servant in county cricket. For the two main stints of his career that has been with Leicestershire, where he helped them to their two Championship titles in 1996 and 1998, before joining Kent from 2000 until 2002. He was a popular player at Canterbury and helped improve their one-day cricket but with the emergence of Geraint Jones the club couldn't afford to keep both. He returned to Leicestershire in 2003 and slotted straight back into their team ethos. His role in Twenty20 cricket has been crucial and he is one of the best players of the reverse sweep in the county game (and possibly world cricket). Still an ultra-competitive player whose drive to be successful hasn't dimmed, that was rewarded when he was surprisingly drafted into the England one-day side in Australia in 2006-07 and did well enough to hold on to his place for the World Cup immediately afterwards, where he was solid with the bat - if not spectacular - and forever experimental with the vocals. Named in England's 25-man development squad it appeared he was heading for a Test debut at 36, but was overlooked for Matt Prior. Superbly fit and motivated, he remained an important part of Leicestershire's set-up and after the 2010 season signed a new one-year contract with the county.

In opponents' eyes, he was England's most wanted man for the seven years until his retirement at the end of the 2001 Ashes. Thrust into the captaincy at the age of 25, he proved more durable than successful, but after finally resigning in 1998, he slipped comfortably into the role of elder statesman. Australia seldom saw the best of him, but his relish for a personal duel did much to bring about series victories over both South Africa (1998) and West Indies (2000).  He retired in 2001 and slipped easily into the media, establishing a reputation as one of the better player-broadcasters as well as a no-nonsense journalist.\n"", ' \n', 'It surprised nobody.

He was McGrath's bunny for the sixth time in this series and for a world-record 19th time in all."", 'But records are just numbers, and numbers tell you next to nothing about Atherton. A final Test average of 38 adds up to just an adequate Test cricketer. But he was more than adequate, much more. For a decade he held England together. Nobody in the world has scored more Test runs since the start of the 1990s. He was the toffee apple surrounded by candy floss, the wicket above all others that the opposition savoured.', 'He was strong off the back foot, happiest pulling the fast bowlers, happiest of all when his back (which gave him much pain over the years) was forced against the wall. His defining moment came at Johannesburg in 1995-96, with a 643-minute 185 not out, which defied the forces of Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock and saved a Test that had been down and out. Make that defining monument.', 'And then two and a half years later, again against South Africa, again against Donald, he sealed his reputation. At Trent Bridge, in a session of cricket which parched the mouth, he resisted a furious onslaught of short-pitched bowling from around the wicket to take England to a series-turning victory.', 'Though he has never worn his nationality on his sleeve like Alec Stewart, Mike Atherton is nothing if not English. From his stubbornness to his accent, from his scruffiness to his guts, he oozed pride in his job - never made excuses for a bad shot, always knew that there was more to life than a century. And despite his media persona of impeccable grumpiness, perfected during his record-breaking run as captain, he was much loved by the public. An Englishman who made runs during the 1990s was forgiven anything.', ""He was an unconventional cricketer. He didn't marry early, he hasn't had children, he didn't care to flash his private life around the papers. He preferred Pat Barker to Tom Clancy and chess to PlayStation. He wasn't afraid of controversy - the dirt-in-the-pocket affair, his unconcealed disagreements with his second chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth, his early promotion to the captaincy over the head of the un-Cambridge-educated Stewart."", 'He wanted to leave without a fuss, and he did.

He excels at music and school and took his double-first at Cambridge seriously. But cricket had become his chosen career.

He was rewarded with a Twenty20 debut a month later against Essex, where he starred with an unbeaten 30 from 18 balls before a tidy spell helped win Surrey the game and Ansari the Man of the Match award.', 'But it was in Championship cricket that Ansari has made his biggest impact. He emerged as an opening batsman of guts and old-fashioned defensive solidity before dropping into the middle order in later seasons. In 2014, he topped 1000 first-class runs at a distinctly un-21st century strike rate of 36. His left-arm spin was used primarily on wearing pitches in the second innings.

His talents have been particularly apparent in Test cricket where his command of swing bowling, especially on his home grounds, has been the stuff of artistry, bearing comparison with any swing bowler in any age. He has been an integral part of three victorious Ashes campaigns and became the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets, leaving Ian Botham's previous benchmark of 383 a mere dot on the horizon. His one-day career has also had its moments as he gradually became adept at bowling in a more defensive fashion, but it is as an attacking swing bowler where he has had few peers. \n"", 'Anderson\'s 500th Test wicket came in September 2017 when he dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite in a Lord\'s Test against the West Indies. It was a delivery that illustrated his talent, coming down the slope to hit middle stump (his 501st - to bowl Kieran Powell - was even better). He became only the sixth player, and third pace bowler seamer after McGrath and Courtney Walsh, to reach the landmark and admitted to feeling emotional. ""Normally it\'s anger but today it was a bit more, not quite teary but emotional. I don\'t get like that when trying to focus on my job and it took me a bit by surprise.""', 'Anderson has been something of a contradiction. He has had a reputation for being shy and uncommunicative off the field, except in the company of close friends, yet on the field his verbal aggression, which he has argued is necessary to conquer that diffident character, not always endeared him to opponents or critics.', ""For the first six years of Anderson's international career, the best way to sum up his bowling was to paraphrase Mother Goose: when he's good, he's very, very good - and when he's bad, he's horrid. But when the force was with him, he was capable of irresistible spells, seemingly able to swing the ball round corners at an impressive speed."", ""Anderson had played only three one-day games for Lancashire when he was hurried into England's one-day squad in Australia in 2002-03 as cover for Andy Caddick. He didn't have a number - or even a name - on his shirt, but a remarkable ten-over stint, costing just 12 runs, in century heat at Adelaide earned him a World Cup spot. There, he produced a matchwinning spell against Pakistan before a sobering last-over disaster against Australia."", ""Five wickets followed in the first innings of his debut Test, against Zimbabwe at home in 2003, then a one-day hat-trick against Pakistan, but his fortunes waned. For a couple of years Anderson was a peripheral net bowler as attempts to change his action to avoid injury affected his pace and rhythm. That oft-predicted stress fracture kept him out for most of 2006, but he still made the Australian tour and the World Cup. However, as England's 2005 Ashes-winning attack began to fall apart, Anderson made his second coming - starting in Wellington on the 2007-08 tour of New Zealand, where he and Stuart Broad were united for the first time. The same opponents were blown away at Trent Bridge (Anderson 7 for 43) a few weeks later, during a summer that earned Anderson the honour of being named among Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year. He marked the award, given at the start of the 2009 season, by making the West Indians looked clueless at Chester-le-Street (nine wickets in the match)."", 'In 2010 Anderson came of age in a staggeringly comprehensive fashion. No longer content with being unplayable when the mood caught him, he took the decision to shelve the ""magic balls"" and concentrated on hammering out a rock-solid line and length, with dot balls and maidens his new holy grail. The upshot was a scintillating year in which he proved unhittable in every sense, with an economy rate that ramped up the pressure in every spell, and a range of weapons that made him a threat on every surface. ', 'A career-best 11-wicket haul against Pakistan at Trent Bridge, when he came as close to unplayable as at any time in his career, was the prelude to a breakthrough tour of Australia in the winter of 2010-11. Anderson arrived to a torrent of doubters, who recalled his forlorn performance on the preceding Ashes four years earlier, in which he had taken five wickets at 82.60. But he left with a series-sealing 24 scalps at 26.04, and a reputation transformed. ', 'Deadly with conventional swing and seam, and with a new line in reverse swing as well, he had become arguably the most complete fast bowler in the world. He was awarded the Freedom of Burnley - his home town - in 2012, which was also his benefit year, and also eased past Brian Statham\'s 252 Test wickets to become Lancashire\'s most successful England bowler. His increased range was demonstrated in India the following winter, when Anderson claimed 12 wickets at 30.25 but was described by MS Dhoni as ""the major difference between the two sides"".', ""In 2013, fittingly at Lord's, a ground where enjoyed much success, he became the fourth England bowler to reach 300 Test wickets when he had Peter Fulton caught at slip. When he began the Ashes with a match-winning 10-wicket haul at Trent Bridge his form showed no signs of abating, but the following nine Tests against Australia were far less successful as a chastened England returned home after the battering down under in 2013-14."", ""Anderson took 37 wickets in seven Tests against Sri Lanka and India in 2014, but his reputation was sullied by a verbal confrontation in the first Test at Trent Bridge with India's Ravindra Jadeja and accusations of pushing and shoving on the way in the dressing room corridor. India insisted that his behaviour had become unacceptable, but the resulting ICC investigation could not separate the truth from the lies and both men got off lightly. The World Cup in the antipodes was another unhappy episode, as the curtain came down on Anderson's 194-game ODI career - another format in which he was England's leading wicket-taking exponent - after an ignominious group-stage exit."", ""By then, England's Test bowling records were bound to fall his way. He passed Botham's record Test-wicket haul in the Caribbean and shortly afterwards reached 400 against New Zealand at Headingley. His fitness remained exemplary, his action as rhythmical as ever, and his appetite still powerful enough to imagine, as he passed his 33rd birthday, playing for another five years. A northern spring, Sri Lanka the opposition, cheered him with three five-wicket hails in successive Tests in Leeds and Chester-le-Street in 2016, but a shoulder injury marred his summer and he was innocuous on Indian pitches as England slumped to a 4-0 defeat that winter.

He has served England with distinction as a nightwatchman on numerous occasions and went 54 Test innings before collecting a duck, an England record.

In the last of his 11 Tests, in Barbados in early 2009, Ambrose made an unbeaten 76 and kept tidily enough in tricky conditions as West Indies batted for the best part of 200 overs. \n', 'Sent back to county cricket and ordered to score more runs, he duly made a century for England Lions against the touring West Indies and another against Hampshire in the Championship. But the selectors never rang again. Not even to offer an explanation.', 'Perhaps they felt his batting was over-reliant upon the cut. Perhaps they felt that he was prone to fluctuations in form that rendered him somewhat unreliable. But in an age when many keepers are manufactured, Ambrose was highly accomplished with the gloves and, by jettisoning him when he was just 26, England probably never saw the best of him.', ""Born in Australia, Ambrose utilised the British passport he gained via his mother to move to the UK as a 17-year-old in 2000. He soon signed for Sussex and, as naturally gifted keeper and batsman, he made his first-class debut the following year and, by 2003, the year Sussex won the first Championship title in their history, he had gained the lion's share of the keeping duties from Matt Prior. He also scored more than 900 runs at an average in excess of 40."", ""The contest between the two of them was to be a theme of Ambrose's career. Even though there were times when he took the gloves from Prior for Sussex and England, Prior always returned stronger to reclaim his position."", 'For that reason, Ambrose took the decision to leave Sussex at the end of 2005 and make a new start at Warwickshire. He made a century in his second first-class game for the team and started the 2007 season with a career-best 251 not out against Worcestershire. The England selectors took notice.', ""His Test debut came in New Zealand. After a half-century on debut, he made a century at Wellington in his second match that turned the series in England's favour. But he was unable to sustain that form and, by the time England left for their tour of India, he was Prior's reserve once again. His one return, for that game in Barbados, came when Prior flew home to witness the birth of his first child."", ""Ambrose's form fell away sharply in 2010 and he averaged only 13 with the bat. He later revealed he had been suffering from an episode of depression and, by the end of that season with his contract finished and his love for the game ebbing, he cleared his locker at Edgbaston in expectation that his career was over."", ""Warwickshire were patient, though. With the help of a psychologist, he recovered something approaching his best form in 2011 and then played a key role in his side's Championship triumph of 2012. Despite some problems with a persistent hip problem, he retained that form in the following three seasons and featured in Birmingham's NatWest T20 Blast success in 2014.\n"", ' ']",[],11.0,16.0,1.0,447.0,102,29.8,963.0,46.41,1.0,3.0,55.0,4.0,31.0,0.0,5.0,5,1,10,6,2.5,34,29.41,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,1.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,1.0,1.0,239.0,363,34,10950,251*,33.28,21109,51.87,17,65,,,639.0,40.0,178.0,144,20,4006,135,32.3,5035,79.56,3,23,,,170.0,34.0,106.0,66,19,1138,77,24.21,1012,112.45,0,3,95,15,66.0,24.0,11.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,5.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,1.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,239.0,,17,1,1,1/0,1/0,1,0.35,17,0,0,0,178.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,106.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Overton took 46 Championship wickets at 22.39 and turned in decent limited-overs performances, too, as he threw himself into the fray. He swung the ball, his 6ft 5ins frame meant he could hit the shoulder of the bat and he was increasingly accurate. His brother Jamie was still quicker, but it was Craig, more reliable and less prone to injury, who had first stirred England's hopes. He was also called into England's limited-overs squads during the 2016 and there was disappointment at Taunton for England's first T20I there in 2017 when he did not make the XI. \n"", ""\nOverton showed signs of developing into an England allrounder during an excellent Somerset season in 2015 which brought runs and wickets in all formats and rather too many brushes with authority for his own good. The highlight was 43 Championship wickets at 21.70, the lowlight was three brushes with umpires - the worst of them at Hove when he abused Azhar Zaidi, a Pakistan-born cricketer with a British passport.  By the end of the season, it had brought him a two-match ban under the totting-up procedure and a reputation for an unbuttoned lip that was not about to go down well in high places. He claimed not to recollect his comment, but specialist one-on-one sessions with psychotherapist Abbie Kench followed, on the suggestions of Somerset's coach Matthew Maynard, leaving Overton able to join England Lions' Loughborough camp at the end of 2016 with no more transgressions on his record."", ""From the moment that the Overtons took the field for Somerset, English cricket has anticipated the possibility that they could become the first twins to represent England in international cricket. The nearest that has come to happening was when Eric Bedser played alongside Sir Alec Bedser only in a practice game against Tasmania on England's 1950-51 tour of Australia. It almost took place in 2015 when they were 21, both twins being called up to England's ODI squad because of injuries, but neither being selected."", 'The older of the Overton twins - he was born three minutes before Jamie - Craig made his way into first-class cricket a month earlier and looks to be the more polished cricketer of the pair. Although lacking some of the speed of Jamie, Craig still generates decent pace from a high action that faintly evokes Stuart Broad and appears to have to have the technique to bowl a consistently probing line and length.', 'Products of Instow CC, both represented Devon in age-group cricket before graduating to Somerset and the England U19 set-up in early 2012. Craig played seven Championship matches that summer, winning a place at the U19 World Cup and then the Lions tour to Australia in early 2013. While a stress fracture of the back ruined his 2013 season, he was named in the ECB Potential Emerging Player Programme in South Africa at the start of 2014 and the Lions tour to South Africa the following winter. In between times, he enjoyed a fine season with 42 first-class wickets at 28.52 apiece, including a maiden five-wicket haul - 5-63 - against Durham. He can bat, too. An innings of 86 against Sussex in 2014 was followed by 99 against Lancashire. ', 'The twins are hard to tell apart. Jamie was generally regarded as quicker, more extrovert, more suited to Test cricket. Craig was steadier, an allrounder, better suited to one-day cricket, and more of a batsman whereas Jamie is a hitter. But it was Craig who made the greater strides, summoning spells of some hostility that might have led some to mistake him for his brother.', 'Overton took seven wickets in three Tests in Australia and New Zealand in 2017/18 and his combative style won respect, but England looked elsewhere throughout 2018 and he gave them limited cause to select him, a hounding of Yorkshire at Headingley and late-season hat-trick against Nottinghamshire at least securing more Lions tour recognition.

He had also developed a doosra after working with his friend and sometimes Worcestershire teammate, Saeed Ajmal.', 'But it was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. He made an outstanding, unbeaten century in his second Test, at Headingley, as England went within two balls of saving the series and while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an England spinner in a Test, he struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling in his first three appearances.', ""That changed in training for the Lord's Test against India. Encouraged by team-mate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test offspinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an on-looker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight."", ""It was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord's, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent and the best since 1967 when Ray Illingworth bowled 30 more overs and claimed one more victim."", 'While he struggled to recapture his batting form in Test cricket, he took his chance when promoted to the top of the order in the ODI side by hitting a 72-ball century in Colombo and ended the year a regular in all formats.', 'He had looked destined for such success for some time. Signed by Warwickshire as a 15-year-old, he made a century on first-class debut against Cambridge MCCU (he remains the second-youngest man to score a first-class half-century for the club) and Championship debut against Nottinghamshire but was dropped for the next game on both occasions. He also captained England U-19s to the semi-final of the 2006 World Cup, blasted a 56-ball century in an U-19 Test against Sri Lanka and, as a 14-year-old, smashed 195 not out in a Twenty20 match for his under-15 club side Moseley Ashfield. The next highest score was 11.', ""But, frustrated by a lack of opportunity at Warwickshire during Mark Greatbatch's ill-fated reign as coach of the club, he left for local rivals Worcestershire at the end of 2006 and was a key part of the team that won the Pro-40 title in 2007. It included a 46-ball century against Northants in 2007; there had, at the time, been only one faster List A century made in England in matches involving two first-class counties."", ""There were setbacks. Trying to combat a tendency to nick off, he went through a period of batting like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and then a spell of leaving balls that hit his off stump instead. But he made 1270 runs at 47.03 in 2010 and 1375 runs at 62.50 in 2013 - the year he won the PCA's most valuable player award - as he augmented his flair with increased discipline outside off stump.

England's interest waned as a result, even though Onions' form in county cricket remained masterful.  Intimations were that his pace was slightly reduced and that he prospered on responsive Riverside pitches. Nobody was presented more often as an example of England's alleged lack of regard for achievements in the county game. \n"", 'That back injury was serious enough for him to fear he might never play again. He needed extensive surgery and privately feared that his career might be over as he was kept out action for a season.  A five-inch titanium pin was inserted in the left side of his back to heal and prevent a recurring stress fracture - ""imagine a broken polo mint that is starting to crack"" is how Onions explained it - and a long period of rehabilitation began. He considered retraining as an umpire, a coach or even leaving the game and becoming a teacher', 'But he fought his way back, firstly with Durham and then, after a 29-month absence from international cricket, for England against West Indies at Edgbaston - after a long road to recovery.', ""He first caught the eye during the 2006 season and did enough to earn a place in England's provisional 30-man squad for the Champions Trophy, but it wasn't until 2009 that he secured his Test debut. He was called up to replace Darren Gough in England's one-day squad against Pakistan in September 2006 and that winter toured Bangladesh with England A. The 2007 season was more of a struggle as Ottis Gibson's outstanding form often forced him out of the side, but he still spent the following winter with the England Lions where his game continued to develop."", ""As Durham claimed their maiden Championship title in 2008, Onions spent most of the season laid up with a string of injuries, and when he was fit couldn't force his way back into a strong line-up. No honours followed that winter, but hard work on his fitness paid off at the start of the following season when strong form was rewarded with a call-up to the squad to face West Indies. Then, as if making up for lost time, he hurtled onto the honours board with debut figures of 5 for 38, including a sensational spell of four wickets in seven balls. He subsequently played an important role in England's successful Ashes campaign, including a memorable double strike from the first two deliveries of day two of the third Test at Edgbaston."", ""His stature grew during England's tour to South Africa after the Ashes, where it was not just his wicket-to-wicket seam bowling that made an impact. He could almost lay claim to the Man-of-the-Series award as he twice held firm with the bat to salvage a draw for his side from the brink of defeat. In the first Test at Centurion, England were nine down when Onions came out to join Durham team-mate Paul Collingwood with 19 balls remaining. He repelled 12 deliveries to ensure England remained level and then, in the third Test at Cape Town did it all again. England had once again collapsed and it was left to Onions to withstand 11 deliveries, including a hostile final over from Morne Morkel, to defy South Africa once more."", 'The following week he was controversially omitted for the final Test and although he began the subsequent tour of Bangladesh, he soon flew home. It was the start of his biggest fight yet as injury soon struck. ', 'Onions made his return to the international fold, claiming 4 for 88 in the rain-affected draw against West Indies at Edgbaston in the in June 2012.  It was his only England action of the summer, although his form for Durham was outstanding. He took 64 Championship wickets at 14.98, his most noteworthy performance a career-best 9 for 67 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, where he denied himself the chance of taking all 10 wickets by running out Luke Fletcher.  He was chosen for the England squads that toured India and New Zealand in the 2012-13 winter programme. ', ""Durham's title success in 2013 was built on his foundations.  No one took more wickets, no one who took more than 20 wickets did so at a lower average, and no one took more five-wicket hauls.  But he was still shunned by England, who misguidedly took a trio of giant fast bowlers to Australia instead. His only failing, it seemed, came when he was pitted against the England tape measure. When injury disrupted his 2014 season, at 31 his chances of an England recall were slim but he still carried a heavy Durham workload uncomplainingly."", 'Surprisingly, he broke links with Durham in 2017, rejecting a two-year contract at Durham where the second year depended on him remaining injury free and joining Lancashire where he could also contemplate more coaching opportunities. That he had not lost the bowling knack was underlined in his first season when he took 57 wickets and he and Ron Bailey (who took 64) claimed 49% between them.']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2007'],9.0,10.0,7.0,30.0,17*,10.0,97.0,30.92,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1,0,1,1,1,2,50,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,182.0,238,85,2035,65,13.3,3911,52.03,0,1,,,34.0,0.0,91.0,34,12,162,30*,7.36,211,76.77,0,0,,,13.0,0.0,47.0,14,7,62,31,8.85,60,103.33,0,0,6,2,10.0,0.0,9.0,16,1606,957,32,May-38,7/102,29.9,3.57,50.1,2,1,0,4.0,4,204,185,4,Feb-58,Feb-58,46.25,5.44,51,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,182.0,,31637,17702,678,Sep-67,,26.1,3.35,46.6,29,28,3,91.0,,3784,3224,104,Apr-45,Apr-45,31,5.11,36.3,2,0,0,47.0,46,990,1133,38,Mar-15,Mar-15,29.81,6.86,26,0,0,0

Shahzad has proven his worth time and again with a series of thrilling batting displays, often producing his own version of the helicopter shot, and his fearlessness at the crease makes him one of the few Associate batsmen capable of standing toe-to-toe against Full Member opposition. \n', ""Shahzad had yet to make his debut when Afghanistan's magic carpet ride took them from WCL Division Five in 2008 to three straight promotions up the Associate cricket ladder, but he proved to be a valuable addition to the squad at his maiden tournament, the 2009 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. Needing a win in their final Super Eight match to secure ODI status for an initial four-year period, Shahzad struck 73 in a 21-run victory over Namibia. Afghanistan made that that cherished ODI status more permanent, with Shahzad at the forefront of the batting unit, most prominently in T20s. He has played a starring role in each of Afghanistan's World T20 Qualifier campaigns to secure four consecutive berths at the World T20, beginning in 2010, and he is far and away his country's career leading scorer in the format. "", ""Due to his adventurous strokeplay and the nature of Afghanistan's membership status, Shahzad has sometimes been unfairly stereotyped as a limited-overs specialist but he has an adaptable technique to play long-form cricket too. Eleven days after his 64* off 46 balls ensured a successful chase against Ireland in the 2010 World T20 Qualifier final, Shahzad engineered one of the greatest heists in first-class history, scoring a fourth-innings 214 not out to overhaul a target of 494 in a 2010 Intercontinental Cup match against Canada. "", ""The one blemish on Shahzad's ledger is linked to his weight, which has been a fluctuating concern under different management regimes. The short and stocky wicketkeeper received a major wake-up call when he was left out of Afghanistan's final 15-man squad for the 2015 World Cup on fitness grounds by then coach Andy Moles. The sting of missing Afghanistan's maiden appearance at the ICC's showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand spurred him on to a wondrous revival and at the end of 2016 he was named the ICC Associate & Affiliate Cricketer of the Year, the first Afghan to claim the honour. "", 'In January 2017, Shahzad achieved a rare feat of scoring two T20I half-centuries in a day, leading Afghanistan to victories over Oman and Ireland in the morning semi-final and evening final of the inaugural Desert T20 Challenge in Dubai. It would later emerge that in a drug test taken just days earlier, Shahzad tested positive for the banned substance Clenbuterol, which Shahzad claimed to have inadvertently ingested through his use of the weight-loss supplement Hydroxycut. After a provisional suspension started in April 2017, he was retroactively suspended for one year and became eligible to play again on January 17, 2018.

He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage. \n"", ""Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI."", ""Nabi has remained the backbone of the side that qualified for the World Twenty20 in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and, recently, the 2015 World Cup. Nabi has had a couple of stints as Afghanistan's captain, taking over the role from Nawroz Mangal in March 2013 and leading the side to the 2015 World Cup. He has overseen rapid changes in Afghanistan's cricket but has remained calmer than most.

A year and a half later, while back on tour in Zimbabwe in February 2017, the precocious legspinner fetched the highest ever bid for an Associate player in the IPL Auction. He was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 4 crores (US$ 597,000).  \n"", '\nIn the intervening time, Rashid quickly established himself as an automatic pick for Afghanistan. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batsmen under constant pressure by bowling quickly through the air, akin to his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is a very accurate googly, and should it result in a wicket, don\'t be surprised if he borrows Afridi\'s signature ""Star man"" celebration. ', '\nRashid is also an athletic fielder, often placed in the covers, a region of high traffic in one-day cricket. With bat in hand, he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings and has air-brushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team. ', ""\nDomestically, Rashid has been a productive force for the Kabul Eagles franchise. He parlayed his success from a superb first season with Sunrisers into franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - with whom he claimed the CPL's first ever hat-trick in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash. He continued scaling new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive and later in 2017 helped spin his country to victory over West Indies in their maiden ODI in the Caribbean with figures of 7 for 18, the fourth-best haul for anyone in ODI cricket. It all added up to Rashid being honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. "", ""In January 2018, Rashid's status as a global superstar was cemented when he became Afghanistan's first IPL millionaire after Sunrisers reclaimed him at auction for INR 9 crores (US$ 1.4 million). Rashid's charisma has turned him into a crowd favourite at every stop. After showcasing his dominance in franchise leagues and against Associate competition, Afghanistan's promotion to Full Membership and entry into Test cricket is an opportunity for Rashid to demonstrate his ability to be a transcendent figure across all formats.""]",[],2.0,3,0,29,12,9.66,31,93.54,0,0,3,1,0.0,0.0,57.0,42,9,782,60*,23.69,776,100.77,0,4,70,22,18,0,38.0,17,8,123,33,13.66,99,124.24,0,0,8,8,11.0,0.0,6.0,7,1,154,52,25.66,198,77.77,0,1,21,1,0,0,59.0,43,9,803,60*,23.61,790,101.64,0,4,75,22,19.0,0.0,155.0,70,26,572,56*,13,376,152.12,0,1,35,43,44.0,0.0,2.0,3,485,256,9,May-82,7/102,28.44,3.16,53.8,0,1,0,57.0,54,2833,1845,123,Jul-18,Jul-18,15,3.9,23,4,4,0,38.0,38,864,867,75,05-Mar,05-Mar,11.56,6.02,11.5,3,2,0,6.0,11,1664,783,44,Aug-74,12/122,17.79,2.82,37.8,1,5,1,59.0,56,2940,1933,127,Jul-18,Jul-18,15.22,3.94,23.1,4,4,0,155.0,154,3587,3644,237,05-Mar,05-Mar,15.37,6.09,15.1,5,2,0

The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era. \n"", 'A tall, hulking presence at the crease, Zazai made waves as a 20-year-old by striking back-to-back half-centuries in just his second and third matches to ensure a T20I series sweep of Ireland. In the final match at Bready, he single-handedly outscored Ireland with his 82 off 54 balls, which included seven sixes.', ""If that wasn't enough to grab headlines, then hitting six sixes in an over less than two months later did the trick while batting for Kabul Zwanan against Balkh Legends in the inaugural season of the Afghanistan Premier League in Sharjah. Having already bashed a 44-ball ton earlier in the tournament, Zazai's intimidation factor grew exponentially when he became the sixth batsman in competitive cricket, and third in T20s, to achieve the six sixes feat after carving up left-arm spinner Abdullah Mazari to put his name alongside Yuvraj Singh and Garry Sobers, among others, in the record books. Hidden in the euphoria of the six sixes was the fact that Zazai matched Yuvraj and Chris Gayle for the fastest fifty in all T20 cricket off 12 balls.

Little more than 6ft tall, with a smooth and athletic run-up, his fast arm surprises batsmen and he has a natural full-of-a-length delivery, swinging the ball both ways at pace. A reasonable tailender and with excellent hands in the outfield, Hassan - softly spoken yet fiercely ambitious - represents the talent which exists in Afghanistan. \n"", ""The match at Lord's was a significant step for a bowler whose family fled the bombs of Jalalabad when he was six, and who subsequently learned the game in Peshawar where thousands of his countrymen sought refuge. His family, all of whom hated the game, did their best to encourage education but Hassan's determination - he played the game in secret for years - eventually won them over. He was first spotted when playing for Afghanistan in March 2006 in Mumbai when they defeated an MCC side led by Mike Gatting, where the then MCC president, Robin Marlar, noticed his potential, and was stunned to see him bowling in flat trainers. Hasan toured England with the national side in 2006, playing several matches against county second XIs, winning them all and was drafted onto MCC's groundstaff where he bowled against his hero, Andrew Flintoff, and was quick enough to smash Monty Panesar's helmet in the nets."", 'He ventured north to play for Norden CC in the Central Lancashire League the following year and represented Afghanistan in the 2009 World Cup Qualifiers, where his whippy action on a corrugated pitch earned him his first five-wicket haul, helping his side upset the tournament favourites Ireland. His once apathetic family celebrated back home by sacrificing a lamb and handing it around the small village to poor people.', ""Although Afghanistan missed out on World Cup qualification, they earned ODI status and at their next qualifying event - for the World Twenty20 - Hassan's incisive death bowling and 12 wickets played an important part in their qualification for the tournament in the West Indies. It appears the only thing that might be able to limit Hassan's ambition is the frailty of his own body. In 2012 a knee injury necessitated two operations, and he missed out on the World T20 qualifying final against Ireland in 2013. When he's fit, he completes Afghanistan's varied bowling attack, and his pace, reverse swing and yorkers make him Associate cricket's most lethal bowler.""]",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32.0,17,4,92,17,7.07,171,53.8,0,0,9,2,4,0,22.0,9,6,50,22,16.66,46,108.69,0,0,3,2,2.0,0.0,13.0,17,6,58,26,5.27,139,41.72,0,0,6,3,3,0,49.0,24,7,130,22,7.64,210,61.9,0,0,11,4,8.0,0.0,40.0,16,6,61,22,6.1,69,88.4,0,0,3,2,6.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32.0,31,1518,1153,56,May-45,May-45,20.58,4.55,27.1,2,1,0,22.0,22,478,523,32,Apr-22,Apr-22,16.34,6.56,14.9,1,0,0,13.0,24,2500,1490,67,Jul-61,11/154,22.23,3.57,37.3,2,6,3,49.0,48,2378,1828,84,May-23,May-23,21.76,4.61,28.3,3,2,0,40.0,40,884,991,55,Apr-22,Apr-22,18.01,6.72,16,1,0,0

His 140 not out against a side ranked No 1 in the world in ODIs left England shaken and was regarded in Scotland - and for that matter in many places beyond - as suitable punishment for the ECB which had successfully lobbied for a 10-team World Cup on home soil in 2019 from which Scotland were excluded.  \n', ""His father (Cricket Scotland's photographer Donald MacLeod) did not even think it was his best Scotland innings, pointing instead to an unbeaten 157 against Afghanistan earlier in the year in a World Cup qualifier in Bulawayo, when he expertly dealt with the talented leg spinner Rashid Khan, liberally employing a sweep shot that he put down to his time spent playing hockey. "", ""Two centuries in succession for MacLeod in January 2014 - a 62-ball 113 against the UAE and 175 against Canada - played a major part in Scotland's qualification for the 2015 World Cup. In many ways MacLeod was a surprising poster boy for Scottish cricket. He has roots in the island of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, from where his grandfather moved to Glasgow. When he acted as a substitute fielder for England in an Ashes Test in 2009 he became the first Gaelic speaker to appear in a Test - he was once banned from speaking Gaelic on the field because an umpire deemed it unfair to the other players."", ""MacLeod's hopes of forging a county career as a fast bowler fell apart in 2009 when his action was reported by the umpires after an Intercontinental Cup match. Remedial work followed, including sessions with the former South Africa quick Allan Donald, then bowling coach at Warwickshire, but he was released by the county in 2010. "", ""Nevertheless, hours spent watching the preparations of Warwickshire's England duo, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, proved to be of benefit.

The feat reflects patience and perseverance at the wicket, an element that often went missing for Bangladeshi openers in the first decade of being an elite cricket nation. But the man affectionately known as Golla was never a popular choice: he was maligned as being too slow and dour with his batting, but often did the job that was required of him - see off the new-ball and stabilise the top-order. \n"", ""Hailing from Bakshi Bazar in Old Dhaka, Omar grew up in a family where cricket and football ruled conversations. He preferred the cricket bat and ball, bowling leg-breaks and smashing cuts to the fence, and soon became a regular in the club cricket scene in the early 1990s. One-day cricket never suited Javed, whose batting was of the Trevor Bailey class in obduracy. When Test cricket came around, he wasn't the first-choice opener, with the more fluent but flaky Shahriar Hossain and Mehrab Hossain debuting before him.

He had played enough international cricket to come up with a faster 80 off 117 in 2007 against India just after the World Cup, during which he filled in for the out-of-form Shahriar Nafees in the opening position.', 'He ended his international career after playing against Sri Lanka that year, unable to earn a position in the subsequent series due to his inability to keep up with the pace of one-day cricket.

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. He remained on the sidelines for the next few months but was recalled for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe at home in December.  He scored his maiden half-century at Harare in February 2007 and was picked as the first-choice wicketkeeper, ahead of Khaled Mashud, for the World Cup in the West Indies. \n"", ""He shows sound technique in his glovework and is Bangladesh's first-choice wicketkeeper after Dhiman Ghosh's departure to the ICL. A stodgy lower-order batsman, Mushfiqur has grown into one of the better players of spin in the line-up. After a slow start to his Test career, he found form in the 2008-09 season with stubborn knocks under pressure. He has under-performed as a batsman in ODIs, but his form picked up in 2009 and he narrowly missed out on a maiden ODI hundred on the tour to Zimbabwe. In January 2010 he cracked his maiden Test century, a notable achievement as it came against a strong Indian Test side and was the fastest by a Bangladesh player. And after Bangladesh's unexpected defeat in Zimbabwe in 2011, Mushfiqur was also elevated to leadership role, taking over as captain from Shakib Al Hasan."", ' ']",[],66.0,123.0,9.0,4006.0,219*,35.14,8540.0,46.9,6.0,19.0,478.0,30.0,102.0,15.0,201.0,187,31,5392,144,34.56,6958,77.49,6,32,430,74,164.0,42.0,77.0,69,12,1138,72*,19.96,955,119.16,0,4,98,28,31.0,28.0,107.0,189,20,6007,219*,35.54,,,10,31,,,166,23,280.0,261,44,8271,145*,38.11,,,10,51,,,232.0,79.0,169.0,155,29,3366,86,26.71,2648,127.11,0,19,279,98,88.0,43.0,66.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,201.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,77.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,107.0,,72,34,1,Jan-23,Jan-23,34,2.83,72,0,0,0,280.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,169.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Later in 2003 he was the leading wicket-taker in the series against England. He can bat a bit too, usually employing the long handle. His 77 at Hyderabad in May 1998 was instrumental in Bangladesh's victory over Kenya - surprisingly, their first in seven attempts - while in May 2004 he carved an astonishing 111 from No. 9 to help secure a precious first-innings lead against West Indies in St Lucia. His 5 for 65 helped Bangladesh win their first Test, against Zimbabwe at Chittagong early in 2005, and he also played a vital role in turning around the one-day series that followed.

As long as you enjoy the highlight reel of his career, everything seems rosy: whether it was in becoming the youngest Test centurion in 2001, the unbeaten 158 against India in 2004, the magnificent 100 he made against Australia in Cardiff in 2005 triggering a huge upset, or the innovative 87 against South Africa in the 2007 World Cup, Ashraful provided the entertainment quotient that turned heads towards Bangladesh. When he made a comeback in 2013 after being dropped due to poor form, he made 190 against Sri Lanka.\n \nBut one look at the overall numbers, and it is easy to realise why some of his fans have given up on him. The fact that he has a score of 50 or more roughly 15% of the time he has batted in international cricket is one of those markers, like his batting average, that pulls him down as a batsman. Is it easy to say that he has underachieved, but those who have dealt with him over the years think otherwise, as they have been surprised by his own lack of confidence in his immense talent.', ""His rise from the outskirts of Dhaka to cricket's wonderboy has been well documented. He trained under Wahidul Gani, a dedicated coach who ran his academy in Dhanmondi, before making his club debut for Amorjyoti. After warming the benches for the star-studded Surjo Tarun in the Dhaka Premier League in 2000-01, he made it to the Bangladesh team on the back of a lot of promise and because the selectors were too focused on youth."", 'After his 2007 World Cup performance, the media wanted to see their golden boy take to captaincy, but it didn\'t work out well. He immediately fell further as a batsman in his two-year stint that also saw the loss of players to the Indian Cricket League in 2008. There were allegations of him being willing to play in the rebel league. He lost his captaincy to Mashrafe Mortaza after his affinity for a dab past the wicketkeeper cost Bangladesh a game against Ireland in the 2009 World Twenty20. And as the team started to have more performers, he lost his place regularly in the next few years. However, in March 2013, he made 190 against Sri Lanka in the Galle Test, an evolved innings which earned fulsome praise.\n \nHowever, just when it seemed it was all going to change for Ashraful, he was hauled up by the ICC\'s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit into alleged spot-fixing claims during the season\'s BPL. He confessed to his involvement in match-fixing and was ""kept away"" from all forms of cricket by the Bangladesh Cricket Board pending the submission of the ACSU report.']",[],61.0,119.0,5.0,2737.0,190,24.0,5940.0,46.07,6.0,8.0,335.0,22.0,25.0,0.0,177.0,169,13,3468,109,22.23,4947,70.1,3,20,354,29,35.0,0.0,23.0,23,0,450,65,19.56,356,126.4,0,2,48,11,4.0,0.0,156.0,282,8,7931,263,28.94,,,20,32,,,74,0,255.0,244,23,5630,127,25.47,,,10,28,,,59.0,0.0,69.0,65,4,1346,103*,22.06,1157,116.33,1,4,145,27,21.0,0.0,61.0,67,1733,1271,21,Feb-42,Mar-75,60.52,4.4,82.5,0,0,0,177.0,40,697,661,18,Mar-26,Mar-26,36.72,5.69,38.7,0,0,0,23.0,8,138,210,8,Mar-42,Mar-42,26.25,9.13,17.2,0,0,0,156.0,,11415,6677,192,Jul-99,,34.77,3.5,59.4,,6,0,255.0,,2086,1815,60,Apr-28,Apr-28,30.25,5.22,34.7,1,0,0,69.0,24,353,466,23,Mar-13,Mar-13,20.26,7.92,15.3,0,0,0

The selectors fast-tracked his growth and within a few months, during which he played four games for Bangladesh A in India, the young man from far-off Narail took the new-ball against visiting Zimbabwe.

His on-field performances and off-field professionalism set a benchmark that was followed by peers and juniors alike. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams. \n', 'The best of his ability and temperament were on display in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, when Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. In only his fourth Test as captain, Shakib scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton, performances that offered further proof of his skill and ability to handle pressure. Against the same opponents in 2008, Shakib took 7 for 36 in Chittagong, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking seven or more wickets in a Test innings.', ""In ODIs, Shakib's contributions have been equally vital with bat and ball and he became the first from Bangladesh to achieve the double of 2000 runs and 100 wickets. He also became the first batsman from Bangladesh to score five hundreds, despite mostly batting at No. 5."", ""Being clearly the best player in the team, it wasn't surprising when Shakib was handed the captaincy in 2009 after Mashrafe Mortaza repeatedly got injured during his first tenure. His ability to perform consistently and to stay calm under pressure worked well for Bangladesh, as they won 22 out of 47 games under him, and even beat England in the 2011 World Cup. However, the World Cup campaign was followed by a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a one-off Test and the ODI series, which led to Shakib's removal as captain."", 'His form hardly waned, however, as he quickly bounced back to help Bangladesh bowl out West Indies for 61 in an ODI; a hundred and five-for in the same Test - something he has done twice - followed later in the year. He remained consistent for Bangladesh and his IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders, but in 2014 Shakib lapsed into off-field shenanigans that saw him fined for lewdly gesticulating at the camera from the dressing-room during an ODI against Sri Lanka, then suspended for six months by the BCB for misbehaving with coach Chandika Hathurusingha and threatening to quit Bangladesh duty. The ban was lifted early and Shakib made the vice-captain in the ODI and T20 formats under Mashrafe. His match-winning ability was undimmed and he played key roles in Bangladesh wins during their stellar 2015.

He hadn't fared too badly in those, however, with 350 runs at 35, and his Under-19 coach Richard McInness reckoned he had the talent and temperament to become a future Test captain. With Nafees Iqbal and Javed Omar established as Bangladesh's opening pair, the England trip was a case of watching and learning for Shahriar. He did get an opportunity in the NatWest Series, and cashed in with 75 in the final one-dayer against Australia. \n"", 'He made his Test debut in Sri Lanka in September 2005, and made 51 in his second match. He also got starts in all the one-day games, but converted only one into a fifty. Then in April 2006 he exploded in sensational fashion against the might of Australia, stroking his way to a brilliant hundred, his maiden first-class ton as well as his first in Tests, at Fatullah. His stunning 138, with 19 fours, set up a scarcely believable first-day total of 355 for 5 as the Aussies reeled. He added 33 in the second innings, and a brisk 79 in the second Test to show that this was no flash in the pan.', ""Nafees was appointed vice-captain for the Champions Trophy in India in October with the view of grooming a successor for Habibul Bashar. He also won the Bangladesh's cricketer-of-the-year award for 2006. He proved that the accolade wasn't wasted on him by scoring a hundred against Zimbabwe but failed against tougher opposition in the Champions Trophy. His batting was instrumental in Bangladesh's 5-0 rout over Zimbabwe in December 2006. His batting form slipped the following year and in 2008, joined the Bangladesh exodus to the ICL, He was subsequently handed a 10-year ban by the BCB but revived his international hopes when he cancelled his contract the following year. He was recalled for the tri-series at home in January 2010. Prior to joining the ICL, he opted out of a tour of Australia to concentrate on finishing his MBA program."", ""After being given clemency by the BCB, Nafees was picked for a Test match against India but didn't make a major contrubtion. Tamim Iqbal's injury got him back into the team for the New Zealand series in 2010 during which he struck 73 in the second game of the ODI series.

Obuya also seemed to have found his feet as a Twenty20 batsman in Kenya's rout of Uganda and Scotland in the home tri-series, striking consecutive half-centuries in two thumping wins over Scotland in February 2010. Later that month, he hit his second first-class century - and highest score in four-day cricket - in making 115 in the first innings of an Intercontinental Cup game against Netheralnds, and followed that up with 58 as Kenya wrapped up a five-wicket win. Obuya's run of form was cut short by injury, however, and he was forced to miss Kenya's controversial trip to the World Cricket League Division One tournament in Netherlands in July 2010. \n"", '  \n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,74.0,73,3,1355,93,19.35,2135,63.46,0,6,152,12,39.0,5.0,10.0,10,2,216,65*,27,228,94.73,0,2,22,4,2.0,1.0,23.0,43,2,1196,115,29.17,,,2,6,,,32,3,97.0,95,6,1883,93,21.15,,,0,10,,,56.0,14.0,19.0,14,3,264,65*,24,289,91.34,0,2,27,5,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,74.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,10.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,23.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,97.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,19.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

An investment banker by trade, he returned to the UAE team after an 18-month absence in 2014 and replaced Khurram Khan (with whom he shares an exact birthday) as captain for their 2015 World Cup campaign.

Some encouraging performances, including four wickets against Queensland, were enough to convince the Irish selectors to take him to the World Cup.  \n"", ' \n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.0,16,6,35,14,3.5,56,62.5,0,0,3,1,5.0,0.0,12.0,5,4,7,4,7,13,53.84,0,0,1,0,5,0,14.0,17,8,103,24,11.44,270,38.14,0,0,12,1,5.0,0.0,45.0,28,11,91,22*,5.35,153,59.47,0,0,9,2,10.0,0.0,24.0,9,6,18,9*,6,22,81.81,0,0,3,0,9,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25.0,24,1238,1356,34,Mar-33,Mar-33,39.88,6.57,36.4,0,0,0,12.0,12,251,416,15,Apr-35,Apr-35,27.73,9.94,16.7,1,0,0,14.0,24,2015,1275,45,May-24,May-64,28.33,3.79,44.7,1,2,0,45.0,43,2097,2270,61,May-42,May-42,37.21,6.49,34.3,0,1,0,24.0,24,479,683,28,04-Nov,04-Nov,24.39,8.55,17.1,2,0,0

He made his international debut for Ireland as a 17-year-old in 2010. The accolade was made more remarkable by the fact that he had only been bowling spin for four years, having switched from bowling seam at the age of 13 after coach Brian O'Rourke spotted him bowling spin in a car park during an Ireland age group tour of Wales.  \n"", ""Dockrell immediately established himself as a key player in the Ireland side. He played a key role in Ireland's 2010 World Twenty20 campaign, blending nous with audacity as his flighted twirlers saw off Netherlands in the qualifying tournament before taking 3 for 16 against West Indies and choking England's middle-order with four overs for 19. School exams then prevented him facing Australia in an ODI but a month later he was offered a contract at Somerset, where he had had an association since the age of 15."", ""He made a big impact in just his second County Championship match, taking 6 for 27 to bowl Somerset to victory over Middlesex in their opening fixture of the 2012 season. He helped his side to another win later in the year with 6 for 29 against Durham as Somerset's finished runners-up again. He finished the season with 35 wickets at 28.45 but future seasons proved less successful and the Somerset coach at the time, Dave Nosworthy, suggested that his red-ball game was suffering through a surfeit of white ball cricket. Matt Maynard, Nosworthy's successor, seemed of similar mind, and Dockrell was released at the end of 2015 - ahead of a busy Ireland one-day summer the following year."", ""In 2012 he played in his second World T20 but after three overs of punishment in a bad-tempered defeat to Australia, Ireland's final group match was washed out and Dockrell didn't get a second chance to bowl. But his year ended on a better note when he was named the ICC Associate Player of the Year in 2012. A year later he booked his ticket back to the world stage by helping Ireland win the World T20 qualifier for Bangladesh 2014. That he was cramming in experience at a young age was further emphasised when Ireland qualified for the 2015 World Cup, but the prospect of a 10-team World Cup in England in 2019 left him as just one of many Ireland players with a sense of betrayal."", 'Dockrell learned his game at Leinster Cricket Club in Dublin and played age-group cricket for Ireland since Under-13s. He made his senior debut in 2010: a T20 against Afghanistan in Colombo, where he took 2 for 11; an ODI debut followed in the West Indies. He also captained Ireland Under-19s at the 2012 World Cup. All the while he has not neglected his education, and is studying general science at Trinity College, Dublin. His father, Derek, also represented Ireland in the days when the side was all-amateur and not allowed to qualify for the World Cup. George is playing in a very different era for Irish cricket.

Joyce had switched to England when the 2007 World Cup took place, having helped Irelands through the qualifying tournament, and became the first Irishman in the modern game to play for England. But he did not quite achieve the career he had envisaged and switched back to Ireland just in time for the next tournament in 2011. He had not quite achieved the four-year qualification period, but the ICC recognised a persuasive case and gave him special dispensation.  \n', 'Joyce was born in Dublin, and from a large family with four brothers and four sisters. He was a star for Ireland at ICC Trophy level, scoring 758 runs in 14 matches between 2001 and 2005, at an average of 84.22. But he always had ambitions to play at the highest level and, after completing his English residency qualification in 2005, made his one-day debut against Ireland in 2006. The Irish team included his younger brother, Dominick. Two days later, he represented England in his first Twenty20 International, before missing a month with a sprained ankle. International cricket, though, had whet his appetite and upon his Championship return for Middlesex at Edgbaston he struck a career-best 211 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.', ""He seemed to cement his England place with good performances in Australia - the highlight being a century against Australia at the SCG and then against lesser opponents in the 2007 World Cup, although questions began to be raised about his fluency and he was discarded after England's dismal tournament. Joyce was an important part of Middlesex's middle-order for a decade from his debut in 1999, but his frustration at a stalled England career was evident and after an unhappy 2008 he severed his ties with Middlesex and moved south to Sussex where he became an influential member of the side without ever regaining his England place. "", ""He became Sussex captain in the middle of the 2012 season, succeeding Michael Yardy. He had an exceptional summer in 2014, hitting seven centuries and averaging 66 in the Division One of the Championship, outdone only by Yorkshire's Adam Lyth among regular performers.  The England selector Angus Fraser even suggested that, were Joyce still eligible, he would have been seriously considered as Alastair Cook's opening partner in the Test side. He resigned after Sussex were surprisingly relegated in 2015, leaving Luke Wright to pick up the role in all three formats. The advent of first-class cricket in Ireland left him unsure of his Sussex future at the end of 2016, a season in which he set a new career-best with a masterful 250 against Derbyshire in Derby."", ""An oddity in Joyce's career was a rare form of dismissal in a Championship game against Warwickshire in 2009 when he swept a ball from Ant Botha straight into the pocket of the fielder at short leg, Jonathan Trott, who was leaping to take evasive action at the time."", 'Once Joyce recognised his England career was over, without the Test debut he had craved, he made clear his intentions to return to an international career with Ireland. He was named in an Irish pre-World Cup touring squad in October 2010 - more than five years after his last outing for Ireland - and shortly afterwards was granted special dispensation by the ICC to represent his country of birth at the tournament in February 2011. He explained that he had been driven to qualify for England by his desire to play Test cricket - ""the pinnacle of the game"" - but that as a ""born and bred Irishman"" he was eager to contribute to Ireland\'s success if that chance of Test cricket eluded him.', ""He is one of five members of the Joyce family to represent Ireland.

He tore the heart out of the UAE batting line up in their second innings taking three for eight from his eight overs as Ireland recorded a morale-boosting victory by an innings and 170 runs.

His pace is lively without being express but he has become a valued member of Middlesex's attack - and one of the most reliable new-ball bowlers on the county circuit. He can also be a destructive lower order hitter. \n"", ""Though now a stalwart at Lord's, he actually came through Surrey's age-group sides and was a member of the England Under-19 squad during the 1999 World Cup, subsequently touring Sri Lanka with a British Universities side in 2002. He battled his way into the Surrey side, and in 2005 took a competition-best 6 for 24 in a Twenty20 tie against Middlesex at Lord's. Nevertheless, he moved north of the river to Lord's in 2007 where he felt his opportunities would be greater. And they were. Consistent in all forms of cricket, and with a liking for the big occasion, he took 104 wickets in all three formats in 2008 and began to establish himself as a county stalwart. Surprisingly, he was overlooked for the England development squad, but had his chance to shine in Middlesex's trip to Antigua for the Stanford 20/20 for 20. Together with Steven Finn he led Middlesex's attack in 2011, taking 80 wickets at 20.98 as the county gained promotion from Division Two."", ""In early 2012 Murtagh qualified for Ireland based on his grandparents. He had to wait a few months to become a regular, but, after the retirement of Trent Johnston and Boyd Rankin's defection to England, soon became the leader of Ireland's attack, and took 3 for 33 against England in front of 10,000 spectators at Malahide in September 2013. His withdrawal from the 2015 World Cup because of a foot injury suffered in a training session in Dubai denied him the opportunity he had cherished and he also missed out on a potential appearance in World Twenty20 in India in 2016, this time of his own volition, when he retired from T20 internationals early in the 2015 season. "", ""While his appearances for Ireland were primarily in limited-overs cricket, Middlesex increasingly regarded saving him for first-class cricket as the best use of him. He was yet again Middlesex's leading Championship wicket-take in 2014, with 58 wickets, including ten wickets in the match against Durham. He passed 500 first-class wickets in his benefit year in 2015 and his part in their Championship triumph in 2016 helped win him a contract until the end of 2018.\n""]",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2001'],2.0,4,2,91,54*,45.5,117,77.77,0,1,10,2,0.0,0.0,50.0,31,9,161,23*,7.31,252,63.88,0,0,16,1,15.0,0.0,14.0,5,3,26,12*,13,25,104,0,0,0,1,3,0,219.0,291,84,4004,74*,19.34,,,0,11,,,62.0,0.0,199.0,120,42,792,35*,10.15,,,0,0,,,52.0,0.0,102.0,38,14,227,40*,9.45,213,106.57,0,0,23,4,22,0,2.0,4,408,148,7,Apr-45,6/100,21.14,2.17,58.2,1,0,0,50.0,49,2571,1940,62,Apr-30,Apr-30,31.29,4.52,41.4,4,0,0,14.0,14,268,324,13,Mar-23,Mar-23,24.92,7.25,20.6,0,0,0,219.0,,38470,19661,761,Jul-82,,25.83,3.06,50.5,,30,4,199.0,,9089,7641,256,Apr-14,Apr-14,29.84,5.04,35.5,8,0,0,102.0,101,1984,2727,106,Jun-24,Jun-24,25.72,8.24,18.7,1,1,0

His skill was highlighted in Ireland's famous victory over England in Bangalore at the 2011 World Cup. Mooney took 4 for 63 in England's innings, restricting the batsmen at the death with cutters, yorkers and slower balls. But his contribution with the bat was even more significant. Mooney was clinical in clinching Ireland's win, finishing with 33 not out from 30 balls and hitting the winnings runs when he clipped Jimmy Anderson to the midwicket boundary.  \n"", ""Mooney made his ODI debut alongside his older brother Paul in Ireland's maiden ODI, against England in June 2006. He contributed with bat and ball, claiming the wickets of Marcus Trescothick, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood - though he conceded 79 from his ten overs - and then hit an unbeaten 30. But he was a peripheral player for Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, going wicketless in his two games. After the tournament, he took a break from international cricket to complete his electrical apprenticeship, but returned when he was qualified and was established as a regular in the Ireland team by the World Cup. "", ""In April 2013 he was suspended for three matches by Cricket Ireland for an insensitive tweet about the death of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The following February he left Ireland's tour of the West Indies and took a break from the game due a stress-related illness which had been managed for some time. In a highly revealing interview in September 2014, Mooney admitted the extent of his struggle with depression, saying that he had even contemplated committing suicide. The following day he made a sublime 96 against Scotland, marked by crisp late cuts, and the Malahide crowd were distraught that he just missed out on a maiden ODI century. But more important was that Mooney was enjoying cricket again and had proved his continuing worth in the Ireland side ahead of the 2015 World Cup. "", ""While Mooney's skills seem particularly well-suited to limited overs cricket he has also been a terrific performer for Ireland in the first-class game, and took match figures of 10 for 81 as Ireland beat Afghanistan in the final of the Intercontinental Cup in 2013.

Entering the fray with his team 106-4 - and soon 111-5 - in pursuit of England's 327, he hit six huge sixes in a 50-ball century - the fastest in World Cup history - to set up a historic three-wicket win. It was the highest successful run chase in World Cup history and imbued new urgency into Ireland's claims for greater opportunities against Test-playing sides. Stocky and with his hair dyed pink, in aid of a cancer charity, O'Brien instantly became a poster boy in Ireland and beyond. \n"", ""In the years since, O'Brien developed into a regular presence on the domestic T20 circuit, although his primary contract is with Cricket Ireland. By the end of 2014 he had played for four English counties, and in T20 competitions in Bangladesh, the West Indies and New Zealand. While Ireland have been disappointed by their lack of opportunities - they played fewer ODIs against Full Members from 2011 to 2015 than 2007 to 2011 - O'Brien has remained a formidable cricketer for them, and hit 84* from 47 balls to secure a tie against Pakistan in 2013. He has also captained Leinster Lightning in the new Irish interpro series, and has been given the responsibility of captaincy when Ireland's county professionals have not been available. O'Brien hit consecutive half-centuries as skipper in the ODI series win against Scotland in September 2014."", ""As well as a belligerent batsman, O'Brien is also a canny medium-paced bowler, and he has developed his variations during his time in foreign T20 leagues. He is the younger brother of Niall O'Brien, although the two have very different characters, with Kevin known as being far more laid back. "", ""Kevin has had a critical involvement in Ireland's rise. He represented Ireland at the 2004 Under-19 World Cup in which he racked up 241 runs and, laying down a marker for the future, also struck 35 from 48 balls against England during Ireland's maiden ODI. He also performed usefully in the 2007 World Cup, including making a priceless 52-ball 16* during the victory over Pakistan on St Patrick's Day: one of his most uncharacteristic innings but no less valuable for it. \n"", '\n']",['ICC Associate and Affiliate Cricketer of the Year 2013'],2.0,4,0,226,118,56.5,386,58.54,1,1,26,0,0.0,0.0,133.0,121,16,3262,142,31.06,3686,88.49,2,16,295,78,57.0,0.0,73.0,66,10,1021,74,18.23,819,124.66,0,2,68,46,23,0,43.0,62,10,2007,171*,38.59,3238,61.98,2,14,234,35,33.0,0.0,208.0,189,29,4863,142,30.39,5569,87.32,3,24,424,124,82.0,0.0,202.0,183,29,3217,119,20.88,2453,131.14,1,9,244,145,70,0,2.0,2,60,31,0,-,-,-,3.1,-,0,0,0,133.0,107,4089,3575,112,Apr-13,Apr-13,31.91,5.24,36.5,5,0,0,73.0,51,903,1134,58,Apr-45,Apr-45,19.55,7.53,15.5,1,0,0,43.0,52,2621,1262,44,May-39,Jun-54,28.68,2.88,59.5,2,1,0,208.0,166,6110,5398,166,Apr-13,Apr-13,32.51,5.3,36.8,7,0,0,202.0,131,2087,2664,121,Apr-22,Apr-22,22.01,7.65,17.2,2,0,0

Blessed with great height - Rankin is six feet, seven inches tall - he gained bounce from even the most sluggish of surfaces and claimed 12 wickets in the tournament to help his side to notable victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh. Five years later, he made himself unavailable for Ireland in a bid to play Test cricket with England. The move provoked disquiet in his home country but it appeared to have been justified when he was named in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia in 2013-14, after a series of impressive limited-overs displays for his adoptive country. Progress was fitful, though, and he restored his allegiance with Ireland as 2015 drew to a close. \n"", ""Having spent some time on the staff at Middlesex without ever making it into the first team, Rankin broke into the Derbyshire side on the back of his World Cup success and then moved to Warwickshire at the end of the 2007 season. Hampered by a succession of injuries, it wasn't until 2009 that, having put greater onus on strength and fitness, he began to fulfil his potential. In 2011 he was part of the Ireland side that defeated England in the World Cup game in Bangalore and then passed 50 first-class wickets in a county season for the first time. After one particularly hostile spell in which he struck Marcus Trescothick several times on the body, the Somerset opener praised Rankin for being as good a fast bowler as he faced that season. While consistency and fitness remained an issue, there was little doubt that, when the force was with him, Rankin had the pace, bounce and lateral movement to discomfort any batsman."", 'Rankin made his England Lions debut in 2011 against Sri Lanka A and was selected on the England Performance Programme later that same year. He came very close to being called-up to the Test squad at the start of 2012 when Chris Tremlett was forced out of the series in the UAE due to injury, but was unavailable due to fitness issues of his own.', 'After 37 ODIs and 15 T20Is, he retired from Irish cricket towards the end of 2012 in order to concentrate on winning a place in the England Test side. Having struggled to remain injury free, it was made clear to him that his body could not sustain the burden of playing all formats of the game for Ireland, Warwickshire and England Lions. It was also made clear to him by his then club coach, Ashley Giles, that he would not be guaranteed another county contract unless he committed to Warwickshire and England.', 'After impressing at the start of 2013, Rankin was called into the England squad for the ODI series against New Zealand following injuries to Stuart Broad and Steven Finn. In June that year he played his first game for England, a Twenty20 international against New Zealand. His England ODI debut followed shortly after, ironically in Dublin, where Rankin took a career-best 4 for 46 against his former country, and his returns during the one-day series with Australia were good enough to win him a place in the Ashes squad.', 'The tour did not go as he would have wished. Overlooked until the final Test, Rankin delivered a nervous performance on Test debut that raised questions about both his temperament and the environment within the England squad. He later revealed that he played the game carrying an injury. He was subsequently omitted from England World T20 squad, but thrown a lifeline latter in the year when he was recalled to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa. It was a selection that ended any realistic hopes Ireland had of persuading him to return to them for the 2015 World Cup. They had, until then, retained hopes of the ICC providing special dispensation for a speedy return.', 'Rankin hails from a cricket-playing farming family in Londonderry.

Before his 23rd birthday, he had already hit two ODI centuries against Pakistan. With a natural swagger and belligerence allied to a portly build, Stirling has evoked comparisons with Jesse Ryder. He generates huge power with seemingly little effort and is particularly strong lashing the ball straight or pulling the ball over midwicket.  \n', ""Born in Belfast, Stirling made his ODI debut at the age of just 17. He played for Ireland in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009, and then signed a three-year contract with Middlesex in December 2009. The following year he gave further notice of his talent by thumping a 134-ball 177 for Ireland against Canada in Toronto - the highest ODI score made by an Irishman. While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland's victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland's ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland's tie with Pakistan two years later. Stirling also revealed his big match temperament with a pair of blistering innings - 79 off 38 balls and 76 off 43 balls - against Afghanistan in the finals of the World T20 qualifiers in 2012 and 2013. "", ""While Stirling made a fine impression for Middlesex in limited overs cricket, he languished in the second eleven in the Championship. But when he got a chance in 2014, he averaged 43.87 in six games, suggesting that he was capable of managing the transition between the white and red ball. Although he has been troubled by a back injury, which has limited his ability to bowl, Stirling is also a highly competent back-up offspinner. He has frequently bowled his full allocation of overs for Ireland in ODIs and, with 1-45 from ten overs, was Ireland's most economical bowled during their victory over England in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup."", 'Stirling had long been a curious case in first-class cricket. The discrepancy between his first-class and limited overs returns for Middlesex had been infuriating. Before his maiden Championship hundred, he averaged 27.77 for the county against the red ball, but 41.46 in one-day cricket. So that century, against Yorkshire at Lord\'s in 2017, was a perfect celebration of Ireland\'s elevation to Test status which was formally confirmed on the other side of the Thames, at The Oval, a few days later. ""It\'s about time I did this and also about time I started to score more consistently. That said, I don\'t want to take away my natural instinct to play attacking cricket.

His time at the junior World Cup in New Zealand, however, was far less successful, where he scored only three runs in three matches before being dropped. "", ""After developing through Instonians CC in the Belfast area club scene, he failed to secure a contract with Worcestershire following several trial opportunities in their second XI.

"", ""Since the end of 2013, opportunities have been sparse for Shannon with his only subsequent T20I appearance coming against Hong Kong at the end of the 2016 home summer. He has kept knocking at the door anyway with Northern Knights in the InterPro competition and has been picked in multiple squads for the Ireland Wolves against A sides from New Zealand and Bangladesh. He was included in Ireland's squad for the 2018 World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, but he never took the field.

A naturally talented allrounder, he had never been seriously coached until joining up with the Dutch squad. Borren earned that nickname 'Baldrick' from his team-mates - after the character in Blackadder - and is a chirpy presence in the field. Although his medium pace was taken apart on his ODI debut against Sri Lanka, as he picked up 1 for 94 from his 10 overs, his performances in the World Cricket League in Kenya where he averaged 21.25 in his three games proved enough to earn him a place at the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. In the same year Borren showed his allround ability when he narrowly missed out on a maiden one-day international hundred, getting out stumped for 96 against Canada in Toronto. That confident innings must surely have owed something to Netherlands' thrilling last-ball win over England in the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Lord's a month before. Borren played an important role in that famous win, snapping up the wicket of Eoin Morgan and then cracking a 25-ball 30 that included a monstrous six off Paul Collingwood in the course of a 50-run partnership with Tom de Grooth that tilted the game for Netherlands. In January 2010 Borren was part of the first group of Netherlands players to be awarded central contracts - a vital step in the professionalisation of the game at Associate level - and was appointed captain of the national side for the World Cricket League Division One tournament in July 2010."", '\n', ' \n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58.0,50,5,1004,96,22.31,1176,85.37,0,5,84,19,28.0,0.0,43.0,38,5,638,57,19.33,524,121.75,0,1,60,18,28,0,27.0,50,1,1331,109,27.16,2239,59.44,2,5,151,17,40.0,0.0,153.0,136,20,2746,115,23.67,3235,84.88,2,12,232,53,72.0,0.0,63.0,55,10,863,57,19.17,721,119.69,0,1,72,26,38,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,58.0,51,1979,1620,46,Apr-32,Apr-32,35.21,4.91,43,1,0,0,43.0,30,526,603,18,Feb-19,Feb-19,33.5,6.87,29.2,0,0,0,27.0,41,3197,1652,41,04-Jan,04-Jan,40.29,3.1,77.9,1,0,0,153.0,124,4575,3888,106,Apr-32,Apr-32,36.67,5.09,43.1,1,0,0,63.0,49,832,956,31,Mar-14,Mar-14,30.83,6.89,26.8,0,0,0

Most notable in a long-standing career were two centuries at the 2011 World Cup, including an exhilarating 119 that almost stunned England. Reflecting his dominance, he won the ICC Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year Award three times between 2008 and 2011. Ten Doeschate also played five years for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL - the first Associate player to gain such a contract. \n', 'Born in South Africa, ten Doeschate cited Jonty Rhodes as his hero, and has played for Western Province. He is of Dutch descent, though, enabling him to represent Netherlands and qualify under the European Citizenship law to play county cricket. With his huge hitting, skiddy bowling and big smile, he soon became a cult figure at Essex, where he has played for more than a decade. ', 'The rise in Twenty20 leagues around the world came at a particularly good time for ten Doeschate. His combination of belligerent hitting, particularly to the leg side, and canny medium-pace have earned lucrative contracts not only in the IPL but also in Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe. But after the 2011 World Cup, ten Doeschate appeared to lose interest in playing for the Netherlands, missing the 2012 and 2014 World Twenty20s.', ""Ten Doeschate's first-class batting average is in the high 40s and if he has cause for disappointment it is that his bowling has not developed as much as he would have liked, but whatever his achievements in the longer form of the game, he will always be viewed as a Twenty20 specialist. There were few players more immediately suited to the advent of the shorter form of the game and he invites the question how many more T20 stars exist beyond the main Test nations. "", 'Essex spotted ten Doeschate playing for Western Province on a tour of South Africa in 2003. For a time, Gooch was his regular airport runner so he could play club cricket in Holland at a weekend. The following season, the second season of T20 in England, he signed full professional forms and gradually proved himself one of the finest Essex players of his era.', 'Success for Essex was frustratingly evasive during his career, and he was in the later stages of his career when he was appointed captain in succession to James Foster in 2016. Alongside a new coach, Chris Silverwood, he immediately led Essex back into Division One of the Championship, leading by example by averaging 64 with the bat with four hundreds and suitably scoring the runs that won promotion. He accepted a new two-year contract as he looked forward to first division life.', 'At 37, Essex finally brought fulfilment as he led them to their first Championship for 25 years - and first-ever, incidentally, without his old chauffeur, Gooch. Ten Doeschate suggested Essex had killed the ""myth"" that there was a huge gap between Divisions One and Two and remarked that ""people make too much of a deal about cricket captaincy."" But alongside the coaching pair of Silverwood and Anthony McGrath he built a culture at Essex that landed a punch for the smaller, non-Test counties. By then he could call himself ""Essex through and through"" and not hear a murmur of dissent.', 'Essex failed to defend their title, but at least ten Doeschate had the satisfaction of spearheading a victory in the last match of the 2018 season to prevent Surrey going unbeaten through the season, his unbeaten half-century bringing a nerve-tingling one-wicket victory that showed the Championship could still provide moments of high drama.', '\n']","['ICC Associate Player of the Year 2008, 2010, ']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.0,32,9,1541,119,67,1757,87.7,5,9,130,29,13.0,0.0,13.0,13,6,300,56,42.85,229,131,0,1,15,10,4,0,174.0,256,38,10283,259*,47.16,,,27,48,,,110.0,0.0,219.0,183,55,5826,180,45.51,,,11,30,,,67.0,0.0,332.0,294,66,6677,121*,29.28,4944,135.05,2,28,412,283,123,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33.0,33,1580,1327,55,Apr-31,Apr-31,24.12,5.03,28.7,3,0,0,13.0,10,210,245,13,Mar-23,Mar-23,18.84,7,16.1,0,0,0,174.0,,10910,7172,212,Jun-20,,33.83,3.94,51.4,7,7,0,219.0,,5457,5241,173,May-50,May-50,30.29,5.76,31.5,6,1,0,332.0,139,2147,2922,114,Apr-24,Apr-24,25.63,8.16,18.8,1,0,0

He was part of the Under-19 side for several seasons and played alongside his brother Gavin at the 2004 Under-19 World Cup. The following year he caught the eye with a sparkling 110 not out against Bermuda in the ICC Americas Under-19s Tournament, dismantling bowlers who went on to play for the senior side in the 2007 World Cup. \n"", ""In 2006, he graduated to the full side, primarily as a batsman but he is a good fielder who can also provide variety with his off-breaks. He had little to do in his first couple of outings but the former  national coach Andy Pick certainly believed he was good enough to be involved. Canada had hoped that playing with and against more experienced players would stand him in good stead as they looked to build on their Intercontinental Cup Final appearance in 2007, but Bastiampillai suffered a slump in form in 2008. He fought his way back to form and fitness, however, and established himself as a reasonably consistent middle-order presence. After a series of failed starts during Canada's trip to Sri Lanka in January 2010, he registered a half-century in each innings against Afghanistan in Sharjah only for Mohammad Shahzad's unbeaten double hundred to guide Afghanistan to a record-breaking win. Yet to fully mature as a batsman, Bastiampillai nevertheless remains an important member of Canada's set-up in the lead-up to the 2011 World Cup.

But it is as a batsman that he has really developed, and his calmness at the crease and ability to penetrate gaps in the field has made him a most effective player in all forms of the game.  After coming through youth teams - he played for Canada's Under-19s when only 15 and went on to captain them - he made his debut for the full side in 1999-2000 when still only 17 and in 2001 was a key member of the side which finished third in the I CC Trophy, thus gaining a place at the 2003 World Cup. That tournament was a personal disappointment for Bagai with the bat, if not the gloves, but he developed well with solid rather than spectacular contributions with the bat. All that changed in the World Cricket League in Nairobi in early 2007 when scored 137 not out - his first hundred in senior cricket - against Scotland and added a second ton against Ireland four days later. His 345 runs at 86.25 meant he ended the tournament as the leading run scorer and was named Player of the Tournament. He was then named captain for Canada's Intercontinental Cup Final against Ireland in May. Consistent performances led him to be shortlisted for the inaugural ICC Associate ODI Player of the Year in 2007.  But his career appeared to hit a wall with a decision to take a job in the UK later in 2007, making him unavailable, though he maintained good form and became an increasingly reliable batsman when he did play. Appointed captain again in 2009, he later turned his back on a successful banking career in the City of London and accepted a full-time professional contact with the board.\n"", ' \n \n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,62.0,60,8,1964,137*,37.76,2995,65.57,2,16,182,8,59.0,9.0,9.0,9,2,284,67*,40.57,249,114.05,0,2,27,0,5.0,6.0,15.0,28,2,825,93,31.73,1545,53.39,0,6,,,37.0,3.0,96.0,93,12,2649,137*,32.7,,,2,20,,,96.0,19.0,23.0,23,3,607,67*,30.35,623,97.43,0,3,44,4,8.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,62.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,9.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,15.0,,27,28,0,-,-,-,6.22,-,0,0,0,96.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,23.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

However, a move back to Colombo in 1993, and a shift in focus to a career as a banker meant that cricket took a backseat although he still turned out for Tamil Union.

Although consistency eluded him at times, there were few players at Australian interstate level as destructive with the bat. Campbell was introduced to the Western Australian team as a wicketkeeping replacement for Adam Gilchrist, but quickly carved a niche for himself as a specialist batsman. With breezy shot-making, he seemed naturally suited to a role as a one-day opener, and he also filled that position in the four-day game, especially after he had registered both the fastest half-century and century in the course of an Australian first-class season in 1996-97.  \n', ""Increasing international appearances for Gilchrist resulted in Campbell's return (on an intermittent basis, at least) to the keeping role, but it was his ability to set the side on flying starts for which he was best known. Among many belligerent innings for the Warriors, arguably the most noteworthy was a whirlwind 108 off only 85 balls that laid the foundation for his team's dramatic victory over Queensland in the 1999-2000 Mercantile Mutual Cup final. In the same season he posted his top score of 203 against Queensland before he endured a difficult 2000-01 following knee surgery, and reportedly considered an offer to move to Victoria. "", 'He elected to stay in Perth and was rewarded with two one-day appearances for Australia in 2001-02 and 2002-03 as well as selection for Australia A. In the following seasons the development of Luke Ronchi kept him on his toes and he eventually made way for him on a full-time basis in January 2006. Campbell finished his career in ninth place on the Pura Cup-Sheffield Shield list of Western Australian run-scorers with 5421, and was fourth on the wicketkeeping dismissals table with 242. He later joined the Indian Cricket League before its third season in 2008-09. ', 'At Nagpur in March 2016, and at the age of 44, Campbell made a remarkable return to international cricket, debuting for Hong Kong against Zimbabwe in the opening match of the World Twenty20. With a Chinese grandmother, and having settled in Hong Kong with his family, his T20I debut came 14 years after his last ODI appearance.']",['Australian Cricket Academy 1994'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,2,0,54,38,27,70,77.14,0,0,6,0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3,0,36,27,12,47,76.59,0,0,6,0,1.0,0.0,98.0,171,6,6009,203,36.41,,,11,37,,,267.0,15.0,105.0,102,5,2286,108,23.56,,,1,10,,,139.0,11.0,5.0,5,0,92,55,18.4,89,103.37,0,1,12,2,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,3.0,3,60,68,2,Feb-28,Feb-28,34,6.8,30,0,0,0,98.0,,24,30,0,-,-,-,7.5,-,0,0,0,105.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,5.0,5,84,101,4,Feb-26,Feb-26,25.25,7.21,21,0,0,0

A promising talent at school level, he made his first-class debut - opening the batting in the first innings - for Mashonaland A at the age of 15. In 2004, Utseya was unexpectedly thrust into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka at the age of 19 when the rebel players withdrew. He held onto a place in a weakened national side and, somewhat surprisingly, took up the captaincy from Terry Duffin in 2006. \n', ""Utseya came of age with the ball during the tour to West Indies in May 2006, where his flight and spin belied his lack of experience and years. But there weren't a great deal of happy memories for Zimbabwe in the years that followed and Utseya tendered his resignation as national captain after the side's disappointing performance at the World Twenty20 in May 2010, saying that he was stepping down in the interest of the team's future development."", 'As it turned out, the move also allowed Utseya to focus on his own development. He formed a useful spin-bowling partnership with Ray Price, the pair making an odd, yet effective, couple and even opening the bowling together when conditions warranted it. Utseya honed his game as a limited-overs cricketer, his parsimonious bowling combining with surprisingly agile fielding and a can-do batting attitude to make him an automatic pick for Zimbabwe in ODIs and a senior member of the squad. He became the second Zimbabwean to take an ODI hat-trick in the course of his 5 for 36 against South Africa in August 2014, and later in the same series sealed his place in Zimbabwean cricketing folklore when he hit Mitchell Starc for a towering six to take Zimbabwe to their first ODI victory over Australia in 31 years.', ""His career hit a major hurdle shortly afterwards, when his action was deemed illegal and he was barred from bowling the offspin that had made him Zimbabwe's most reliable one-day bowler. Utseya was forced to take drastic action, trimming an already minimal bowling action down to its absolute bare bones and remodeling himself as a bowler of slow-medium cutters.\n""]",[],4.0,8,1,107,45,15.28,229,46.72,0,0,12,1,2.0,0.0,164.0,132,48,1406,68*,16.73,2410,58.34,0,4,88,17,50.0,0.0,35.0,21,9,94,13*,7.83,115,81.73,0,0,6,1,6.0,0.0,82.0,137,9,2756,115*,21.53,6515,42.3,1,15,,,33.0,0.0,243.0,193,60,2092,68*,15.72,,,0,5,,,77.0,0.0,84.0,55,24,367,41*,11.83,420,87.38,0,0,21,9,24.0,0.0,4.0,6,753,410,10,Mar-60,5/192,41,3.26,75.3,0,0,0,164.0,160,8571,6239,133,May-36,May-36,46.9,4.36,64.4,2,1,0,35.0,35,749,858,26,Mar-25,Mar-25,33,6.87,28.8,0,0,0,82.0,,14284,6509,217,Jul-56,,29.99,2.73,65.8,8,8,2,243.0,,12220,8683,214,May-36,May-36,40.57,4.26,57.1,4,1,0,84.0,84,1818,1984,75,04-Dec,04-Dec,26.45,6.54,24.2,1,0,0

Jarvis was blooded in the home series against Kenya, and in this and subsequent one-day series in Bangladesh and South Africa, he impressed many with his pace, touching 145kph at times. He lacked control, however, and tended to be expensive, although he continued to pick up wickets. Jarvis made his first-class debut in an Intercontinental Cup game against Kenya in October 2009, and took 6 for 60 in his first Logan Cup game for the Mashonaland Eagles.

A keen sportsman, he has also played rugby for the Zimbabwe U-19s. His comeback to international cricket coincided with Zimbabwe's return to the Test fold.

Born in Harare, Kamungozi first learned to play cricket at Chengu Primary School in the township of Highfield. He was a seam bowler at first, but while a student at Highfield High, at around the time he joined Takashinga Cricket Club, he changed to leg spin. He lived close to the Takashinga ground and came under the tutelage of coaches Stephen Mangongo and Walter Chawaguta. Joining Takashinga was also his only chance to continue playing cricket, as the sport was not played at his high school.\n \nKamungozi was never chosen for a national age-group team and made a somewhat unexpected international debut against South Africa in an ODI in September 2006, at the age of 19. South Africa demolished a woefully under-strength Zimbabwe side, scoring 420, but Kamungozi escaped with relatively light punishment and picked up the wickets of Loots Bosman and Justin Kemp. The following month he toured India with the Zimbabwean team for the ICC Champions Trophy, and did reasonably well against both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\n \nIt wasn't until 2014 that Kamungozi was once again called upon by Zimbabwe, this time for the World T20.

After six years playing club cricket in England (where he was based for work), he returned to Zimbabwe in 1995 and made an immediate impact with Ruzawi, and he was drafted into the Test side against South Africa after twice taking six wickets for Mashonaland Country Districts. He took five wickets in what was to prove his only Test match. He had broken his forefinger badly in the nets a week before, breaking the main tendon, but he could still use it for bowling, if not for batting. He did scored a valuable innings of eight not out in the first innings, in partnership with Heath Streak, the runs coming from two boundaries - ""but those were more from fear of getting my hand hit!"" However the injury put him out of cricket for three months after that, before returning and doing enough to book his passage to New Zealand and the World Cup. He did not play in the Tests but was selected for the last two one-day internationals in the series of three. In the second, at Napier, he took 5 for 5 in 11 balls to turn the match on its head and gain a 21-run victory for Zimbabwe.

But pace isn't Mupariwa's main weapon; a medium pacer who lost a yard after a knee injury in his late 20s, he relies mainly on accuracy, an ability to swing and seam the new ball, and a deceptive slower delivery. Zimbabwe relied upon Mupariwa when their pace-bowling stocks were at an all-time low in the years following the premature retirements of the 'rebel' players, but despite his enviable one-day credentials, he fell out of favour as Zimbabwe searched for genuine express pace bowlers in the lead-up to the return to Test cricket in 2011. \n"", ""Mupariwa is a product of the Bulawayo development programme.

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.  He still tends to blow hot and cold and has few rivals in the race to be considered international cricket's worst batsman, but when Zimbabwe return to Test cricket Mpofu will have an important role to play. \n"", ' \n']",[],15.0,28,10,105,33,5.83,249,42.16,0,0,7,5,4.0,0.0,80.0,39,19,46,6,2.3,198,23.23,0,0,1,0,11.0,0.0,24.0,7,4,16,6*,5.33,30,53.33,0,0,0,1,5.0,0.0,104.0,161,44,1154,57,9.86,3495,33.01,0,1,,,26.0,0.0,178.0,93,42,404,41,7.92,863,46.81,0,0,,,31.0,0.0,71.0,29,15,121,27*,8.64,154,78.57,0,0,6,1,15.0,0.0,15.0,23,2489,1392,29,Apr-92,5/123,48,3.35,85.8,2,0,0,80.0,79,3767,3407,88,Jun-52,Jun-52,38.71,5.42,42.8,2,1,0,24.0,24,515,755,20,Mar-16,Mar-16,37.75,8.79,25.7,0,0,0,104.0,,16635,8598,280,Jul-37,,30.7,3.1,59.4,8,10,0,178.0,,8317,6709,229,06-Aug,06-Aug,29.29,4.83,36.3,7,3,0,71.0,70,1499,1906,69,Apr-17,Apr-17,27.62,7.62,21.7,1,0,0

As a teenager, he put together knocks of 94 against Southerns, an unbeaten 79 against Westerns and 52 not out against Northerns in the 2006-07 Faithwear Inter-Provincial One-Day Competition. He was then part of the Zimbabwe Under-19 team's dire trip to the Youth World Cup in early 2008, but his performances there and subsequently didn't suggest an outstanding talent, and an abductor injury upon his return to Zimbabwe was another set-back. \n \nMire's fortunes began to change when he emigrated to Australia in 2012. As something of a nomadic Grade cricketer, he spent some time in country Victoria and then moved on to Premier Cricket in Melbourne, where he played for Carlton and Essendon while also spending time in Darwin during the winter. He made community paper headlines in July 2014 when he slammed a 157-ball 260, including 21 sixes, for Waratahs to set a new tournament record in the Darwin and District Cricket Competition. His exploits for Essendon in the Victoria Cricket Association Premiership had also led to a game for Victoria Under-23s, and then a handful of games for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League in 2013-14 as a community rookie. Zimbabwe eventually came calling, and Mire cobbled together a pair of fifties in unfamiliar conditions in his debut series in Bangladesh in late 2014.

This was against West Indies in 2000-01 when, batting at No. 3 instead of his normal opening position, he scored a composed 119 that was largely responsible for Zimbabwe saving the match after conceding a first-innings lead of 216. Earlier in the year he had not only become the youngest Zimbabwean ever to score a first-class century, but also the first black player in Zimbabwe to do so - a watershed moment in the country's history.\n \nA year later, though, he put his professional cricket career on hold as he began a three-year course at the University of the Free State. Although an agreement was reached that he would still be available for Zimbabwe if required, he could not maintain his form playing against club opposition in South Africa, and the national selectors initially decided to await his return to the country. But the Rebel crisis led to his early recall in the one-dayers against England where, unsurprisingly, he struggled before registering his maiden ODI fifty in the final game. His return to the Test match team brought mixed results, but he was Zimbabwe's best batsman, technically, on their tour of South Africa, where he showed an application lacking in his team mates.\n \nAfter being criticised for not being able to score quickly enough early on in his career, Masakadza's ability in one-day cricket has steadily increased and 2009 was a bumper year for him. He scored over 1000 runs in ODIs in the calendar year at an average of 43.48 and a strike rate of 88.08, including scores of 156 and 178 not out in the home series against Kenya, the first time a batsman has made 150 or more twice in the same one-day series.\n \nMasakadza was part of Zimbabwe's XI when they played their first Test in six years, against Bangladesh in August 2011, scoring his second Test century a decade after his first. He has continued to show greater dexterity as a batsman, adding a hook and pull to a repertoire that already included muscular play off the front foot. He has also added value to Zimbabwe's set-up as a calm, amiable presence amid sometimes tempestuous times. Masakadza entered the peak of his career after turning 30, and was finally rewarded with a trip to a World Cup in 2015 - remarkably, his first."", '  \n']",[],38.0,76,2,2223,158,30.04,5009,44.38,5,8,264,23,29.0,0.0,204.0,203,4,5604,178*,28.16,7618,73.56,5,34,577,86,71.0,0.0,58.0,58,2,1516,93*,27.07,1295,117.06,0,10,139,58,20.0,0.0,140.0,251,11,9564,208*,39.85,,,23,44,,,124.0,0.0,339.0,337,22,10457,178*,33.19,,,9,70,,,139.0,0.0,122.0,121,15,3812,162*,35.96,3005,126.85,4,28,314,159,52.0,0.0,38.0,24,1164,489,16,Mar-24,Mar-24,30.56,2.52,72.7,0,0,0,204.0,84,1826,1622,39,Mar-39,Mar-39,41.58,5.32,46.8,0,0,0,58.0,9,72,113,2,01-Apr,01-Apr,56.5,9.41,36,0,0,0,140.0,,4130,1831,62,04-Nov,,29.53,2.66,66.6,,0,0,339.0,,3308,2812,86,Apr-36,Apr-36,32.69,5.1,38.4,3,0,0,122.0,29,336,380,19,02-Jun,02-Jun,20,6.78,17.6,0,0,0

He became so good at it that he made his Test debut, against Bangladesh in 2013, he opened the batting.  \n"", 'The move up the batting ranks came after a highly successful domestic season in 2012-13, when he averaged 51.80 in 12 innings for Mountaineers, scoring one century and four fifties. That came on the back of two consistent seasons with the bat, in 2011-12 and 2010-11. Most of those runs were scored from No.5 or 6, yet his organised technique and temperament won him a promotion to the top of the order for his Test debut. ', ""Even as his batting improved, Maruma's legspin took a back seat. In 2009-10, he was the leading wicket-taker by some distance in the Logan Cup, the domestic first-class tournament, taking 58 wickets at 18.94. During that period, he was clearly one of the better slow bowlers in Zimbabwe. In the last two seasons before his Test debut (2012-13 and 2011-12), though, he only took 16 wickets from as many matches, as he lost his stock delivery, the legbreak, and started bowling a mixture of googlies and seam-up quicker deliveries."", ""In the early part of his career, Maruma was seen as a bowling talent. After making his first-class debut against Bangladesh A in 2006, he registered impressive returns in his first Logan Cup, virtually spinning Easterns to the title in partnership with Prosper Utseya. He was rewarded for his outstanding debut domestic season, in which he took 36 wickets at 17.62, with a call up to the national side for the World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, but didn't make it into a starting XI. He made his ODI debut against South Africa in the same year, but he struggled to make an impact and fell out of contention, till he began to concentrate on his batting.

He attended the CFX Academy in 2001 and was posted to Manicaland, where he developed more as a bowler than a batsman, although without losing his ability with the bat -- he has a Test fifty against New Zealand to his credit. He made his international debut against Pakistan at Harare in November 2002, but struggled to make an impact. However, a year later he was recalled for the 2003-04 tour of Australia and made the second Test at Sydney, but failed to take a wicket. Nevertheless, he impressed with his whole-hearted attitude and stayed in the side for the home West Indies series in November 2003. But in May 2004, his action came under scrutiny and he was reported to the ICC after the first Test against Sri Lanka at Harare. With assistance from Kevin Curran, he remodelled his action, becoming more side-on, and returned to the side against India and New Zealand in 2005, impressing with both bat and ball.

His international career has had two clear phases: the first, when he debuted amid the state of emergency in Zimbabwean cricket that came after the sacking of the 15 'rebel' players and the second, when he returned to Zimbabwe an older, wiser bowler ahead of the 2010-11 season.  \n"", ""Panyangara made his international debut at just 18 years old, when he should have been studying for his A levels but was instead opening the bowling against Sanath Jayasuriya. Though it arrived too early, even before his debut it was clear that Panyangara would eventually play for the national side - he'd come to attention on the world stage with a remarkable bowling performance of 6 for 31 that dismantled Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in February 2004.\n \nBut he lasted less than a year in the national set-up before, in early 2005, he developed a stress fracture in his back that kept him away from competitive cricket for a year.  He left Zimbabwe for England, eventually resurfacing as an opening bowler for West Indian Cavaliers, a club side in the Nottinghamshire Premier League. He was a yard slower but, in swing-friendly English conditions, increasingly adept at moving the ball through the air and off the pitch.\n \nPanyangara returned to Zimbabwe in 2010 and slotted almost immediately into the A side. He missed out on a spot in Zimbabwe's team for the Test return against Bangladesh in August 2011 but played an integral role in Zimbabwe's historic win over Pakistan in September 2013. With form, fitness and greener pastures overseas clearing away much of his fast-bowling competition, Panyangara played for Zimbabwe much more regularly in the seasons that followed. He settled into his role as one of the team's senior seamers with aplomb and was known as a lighthearted presence in the dressing room. \n \nPanyangara grew up in Marondera, a country town about 45 miles south-east of Harare, and learned his cricket at the local primary school - Godfrey Huggins. He was a boarder at Churchill High School in Harare, and his allround skill helped him break into the Takashinga Sports Club first team before he'd written his O Levels. He'd sometimes open the batting for Takashinga, and remains a competent, if unspectacular, batsman, occasionally helping the Zimbabwean tail to wag.""]",[],9.0,18,6,201,40*,16.75,385,52.2,0,0,30,2,3.0,0.0,65.0,49,13,239,33,6.63,463,51.61,0,0,19,4,9.0,0.0,14.0,5,4,23,17*,23,17,135.29,0,0,1,2,2.0,0.0,50.0,80,15,1082,89,16.64,,,0,2,,,21.0,0.0,113.0,87,22,622,42,9.56,,,0,0,,,17.0,0.0,24.0,9,6,37,17*,12.33,30,123.33,0,0,1,3,5.0,0.0,9.0,16,1889,813,31,May-59,Jul-89,26.22,2.58,60.9,0,1,0,65.0,65,3242,3024,65,Mar-28,Mar-28,46.52,5.59,49.8,0,0,0,14.0,14,303,398,20,Apr-37,Apr-37,19.9,7.88,15.1,1,0,0,50.0,,7878,3505,129,May-59,,27.17,2.66,61,3,2,0,113.0,,5287,4506,109,Apr-26,Apr-26,41.33,5.11,48.5,2,0,0,24.0,23,483,624,31,Apr-37,Apr-37,20.12,7.75,15.5,1,0,0

He is not a teenage prodigy, nor is he someone who had a burning ambition to play for his country. He journeyed through from his adolescence to adulthood and stumbled upon the sport he sometimes played as a child, only to discover he is quite good at it. \n"", 'Born in Sialkot in the northeast of Pakistan, Sikandar had told his parents when he was 11 years old that he wanted to be a fighter pilot. He wrote the exam that got him into Air Force college. He was one of 60 to have won a place among 60,000 applicants. But in his third year, he failed an eye test. He was told that 7 out of 10 people have the problem in normal life, but for him a dream was shattered.', 'Not dissuaded, Sikandar got admitted to Glasgow Caledonian University, where he picked up cricket as a semi-professional. He moved to Zimbabwe, where his parents had resided since 2002, and he made his first-class debut in 2007. He made one half-century in nine innings before completing his studies and returning to full-time cricket in the 2010-11 season. He had a more fruitful time, scoring 625 runs at an average of 41.', 'The following season was again decent as he developed a reputation as an aggressive top-order batsman. Sikandar kept doing well in the one-day and Twenty20 competitions at the time, so it was natural for the selectors to turn to him for a practice match against the visiting Bangladeshis in 2011 when Vusimuzi Sibanda was injured. He did well, and it became clear that he had a future in Zimbabwe colours.', ""Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) began a process to get him the necessary papers that would qualify him to play for the country and in May 2013, he made his international debut for Zimbabwe, in the first ODI against Bangladesh, thus becoming the 116th player to appear for Zimbabwe in the format. Four months later, he made his Test debut too, against Pakistan in Harare. By the time the 2015 World Cup rolled around, Sikandar was firmly settled into his role as the most adventurous batsman in Zimbabwe's top order, with a fondness for carving the ball through - and sometimes over - point, and a useful side line as an offspinner. "", ""He played a pivotal role in one of Zimbabwe's most memorable moments on a cricket field, winning the deciding ODI against Sri Lanka with a crucial cameo in a pressure situation chasing 204 on a turning track in Hambantota in July 2017. Before batting, he had helped restrict Sri Lanka in that game with what was his best figures in ODI cricket: 3 for 21 in 10 overs. The result?

Like them, he comes from the Harare township of Highfield and earned a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School. Sibanda is an opening batsman and an occasional medium-pace bowler, and was a student at the CFX Academy in 2002. He scored 58 on debut against the West Indies, but his selection for the national team came too early, and despite failing to live up to his potential, the crisis in the national side meant that he kept his place long after others would have been discarded. Despite being a superb timer of the ball off both the front and back feet, he was slow to learn the ability to build a big innings and his selections were due almost entirely to his outstanding potential rather than actual performance. He has a very sound technique, but poor shot selection has often brought about his downfall. Coach Kevin Curran noted that he matured well on the West Indian tour in May 2006. He suffered a hand injury early on, but took his opportunities when given them, starting the tour with 52 at Georgetown, and finishing with a 78 and then a superb century in the Tri-Series final against Bermuda.  \n', ""He had a successful club season in Sydney, Australia, which seemed to have paid dividends when he registered scores of 47, 93 not out, and 64 in the home series against Bangladesh in February 2007. He could not carry this form into the World Cup, however, and his only innings of note in the tournament was 67 in Zimbabwe's tied game against Ireland at Kingston. He returned to Australian club cricket after the World Cup amid questions over his commitment to international cricket, but subsequently returned to Zimbabwe and was selected for the Afro-Asia Cup, making some impressive starts without being able to push on for a big score. He narrowly missed out on a first ODI hundred against a Test-playing nation when he was run out for 96 against the West Indies in Bulawayo in December 2007, and remained in contention for the national side thereafter with the odd good innings. "", 'Sibanda seemed to have fully matured as a batsman during the 2009-10 Zimbabwean domestic season. He was named as captain of the Midwest Rhinos and called up for the Zimbabwe XI to take on Kenya in the Intercontinental cup game at Kwekwe. Responding superbly, he rescued the Zimbabweans with 209 in the first innings and sealed the victory with an unbeaten 116 in the second. This marked the beginning of a rich vein of form for Sibanda, and he rocketed to the top of the domestic first-class batting tables. Before the end of the Logan Cup, he had taken his season tally to almost 1500 runs at an average of 95 with nine hundreds, including a career-best 215. Tellingly, only once did he pass fifty and fail to reach a hundred. With statistics like those, it is hard to see how he can be left out of the national side, and will likely play a major role should Zimbabwe return to Test cricket in the near future. \n', ' January 2010']",[],14.0,28,0,591,93,21.1,1177,50.21,0,2,86,6,16.0,0.0,127.0,126,4,2994,116,24.54,4716,63.48,2,21,328,35,42.0,0.0,26.0,26,1,511,59,20.44,503,101.59,0,1,52,11,12.0,0.0,134.0,245,12,7695,217,33.02,,,18,33,,,157.0,0.0,250.0,244,13,6006,190,26,,,4,39,,,92.0,0.0,72.0,72,7,1584,70*,24.36,1521,104.14,0,8,136,44,29.0,0.0,14.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,11,267,265,3,01-Dec,01-Dec,88.33,5.95,89,0,0,0,26.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,134.0,,2843,1726,39,May-55,,44.25,3.64,72.8,1,1,0,250.0,,809,775,10,Feb-50,Feb-50,77.5,5.74,80.9,0,0,0,72.0,3,15,33,0,-,-,-,13.2,-,0,0,0

Taylor, disillusioned with international cricket, signed a three-year Kolpak deal with Nottinghamshire which made him ineligible to play for Zimbabwe while that contract is in effect. He made his decision slightly open-ended, not entirely ruling out the possibility that he might one day return to the fold. And he did just that. \n"", '""I was concerned about the future of Zimbabwe cricket and with the administration side of it. I felt people were not qualified enough to run Zimbabwe cricket officially and just the way we were treated as players. It was really difficult to try and play the best cricket you could and deal with the issues.""', 'Those who doubted that he would ever return were proved wrong midway through his final season at Notts when he gained permission for an early release, citing homesickness: his wife Kelly had remained in Zimbabwe with their four young sons. He had a more optimistic attitude towards Zimbabwe cricket, too, anticipating that affairs would be better run on and off the field. At 31, he returned to Test cricket, against West Indies in Bulawayo, nearly three years after his previous innings.', 'Since making his debut in April 2004, Taylor was involved in almost every ODI - the format Zimbabwe play most often - his country has taken part in. In 2008, he missed out on 17 ODIs after making himself unavailable because of a dispute with the board and a year before that he was dropped for the last match of a series in Bangladesh and the return home series because of poor form. But, by and large, 216 matches across all formats (167 of them ODIs with a batting average of 34.82) told its own story.', '\nBut Taylor fell out with Stephen Mangongo, an uncompromising Zimbabwe coach. Firstly, he was stripped off the captaincy in July 2013 when Zimbabwe Cricket suffered one of its regular restructurings and the leadership was split with Elton Chigumbura assuming control in the limited-overs formats. He later relinquished the wicketkeeping role because Mangongo asserted that he preferred ""the best man for the job, not a part-timer"". Finally, in August 2014, he was dropped against South Africa when few anticipated such a move. ""It\'s a professional sport, there is always pressure. It is not Boozer\'s XI,"" Mangongo said pointedly. Eight weeks before the World Cup, Mangongo was sacked and redeployed with the Under-19s but Taylor\'s mind was made up.', 'He was the second Zimbabwe player to go Kolpak after their Test comeback with Kyle Jarvis also signing for Lancashire. ', ""Taylor was appointed captain after the 2011 World Cup, as Zimbabwe worked towards a return from a self-imposed exile from Test cricket. He led them to a successful Test comeback later that year, in which he also scored his maiden century, and to a win over Pakistan a month later. Under Taylor, Zimbabwe seemed a renewed force, despite a sparse fixture list and struggles away from home. As one of the senior-most players in the squad, Taylor played an important part in unifying the players in their off-field battles over unpaid salaries and the formation of a players' association."", 'Taylor shot to prominence at Cape Town on September 12, 2007, his ice-cool 60 not out carrying Zimbabwe to an incredible five-wicket win over Australia in the ICC World Twenty20. Taylor marshalled a tense run-chase with the sort of sang froid that few had ever credited him with.', 'As a young cricketer, he was nurtured by Iain Campbell, father of Alistair, at the well-known Lilfordia primary school near Harare, was a regular choice for national age-group teams and played in two Under-19 World Cups. He made his first-class debut for Mashonaland A at the age of 15; the following year he scored 200 not out in the B Division of the Logan Cup, and he was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national team against Sri Lanka in 2003-04 at the age of 18 after the withdrawal of the so-called rebel players. As a batsman he was soon well respected by the opposition, but tended to get out when well set. Poor footwork early in an innings was also a handicap at the start of his career, but he worked to improve that and in November 2009 struck his maiden one-day hundred.', ""That knock proved something of a turning point for him, and in the year that followed he struck centuries against Sri Lanka and South Africa and proved to be Zimbabwe's stand-out batsman at the 2011 World Cup, his trademark uppercut to third man one of the lasting images of the tournament. His star continued to rise as Zimbabwe readied themselves for a return to Test cricket, and in June 2011 he was named captain of the national side."", 'The additional responsibility of captaincy, which he had always fancied, worked wonders for his batting, as he scored four centuries in his first seven Tests in charge, after scoring none in his ten previous Tests. He also scored hundreds in each innings against Bangladesh in Harare in 2013, thus becoming the first from Zimbabwe, and the 12th in all, to achieve this feat. ', ""In July 2014, as part of ZC's split captaincy plan, he retained the Test leadership while Elton Chigumbura took over the limited-overs games. Though he's not very swift in the field, he has a safe pair of hands and kept wicket for Zimbabwe fairly often before Richmond Mutumbami and Regis Chakabva's progress as wicketkeepers allowed him to concentrate more fully on his batting."", ""Taylor's move to Nottinghamshire did not go altogether smoothly. His Championship displays were highly inconsistent. He also caused consternation by falling asleep in an unlocked car after his celebrations of Nottinghamshire's progress to the semi-finals of the Royal London Cup in 2015 went haywire. Taylor had to be woken by police after a Nottingham businessman opened his unlocked Chevrolet Matiz to find Taylor sleeping off a long night close to the Trent Bridge ground. He escaped charges. At least before he departed he managed to pick up a winners' medal in the 2017 Royal London Cup final."", '\n', '\n']",[],28.0,56,4,1840,171,35.38,3564,51.62,6,8,186,15,27.0,0.0,188.0,187,15,6156,145*,35.79,8085,76.14,10,36,537,96,118.0,29.0,30.0,30,5,660,75*,26.4,565,116.81,0,5,58,18,14.0,2.0,128.0,232,13,8807,217,40.21,,,31,31,,,142.0,4.0,298.0,290,26,9327,154,35.32,,,18,51,,,185.0,41.0,144.0,138,19,3202,101*,26.9,2638,121.37,1,23,292,85,57.0,13.0,28.0,4,42,38,0,-,-,-,5.42,-,0,0,0,188.0,21,396,406,9,Mar-54,Mar-54,45.11,6.15,44,0,0,0,30.0,2,30,17,1,Jan-16,Jan-16,17,3.4,30,0,0,0,128.0,,384,225,4,Feb-36,,56.25,3.51,96,0,0,0,298.0,,606,604,20,May-28,May-28,30.2,5.98,30.3,0,1,0,144.0,8,150,152,8,Mar-38,Mar-38,19,6.08,18.7,0,0,0

Earmarked as the long-term successor to club colleague Andy Flower, Taibu was plucked from Churchill Boys High School to tour the West Indies in 1999-00, after impressing onlookers with his natural ability. Three months later he was in England, on stand-by at Trent Bridge after injury put Flower's dual role in doubt. He had yet to play domestic first-class cricket at this stage - his debut for Mashonaland had to be put on hold after he turned up at the wrong ground - but he has toured South Africa with the Zimbabwe U-19s, and was one of Zimbabwe's few bright spots in the 2003 World Cup and their tour to England later that year. A promising batsman, albeit with a penchant for cross-batted strokes, he is steadily improving at Test and ODI level. \n"", ""In April 2004, he was appointed captain of Zimbabwe following the resignation of Heath Streak, and he led a woefully inexperienced by example in the face of repeated heavy defeats.  But the pressure began to tell, and by the autumn of 2005 he found himself at the front of another players revolt, this time widely backed and against the general  mismanagement of the board.  It led to him being villified in the domestic press and threatened by some unsavoury elements connected to the board itself, and in November 2005 he announced his resignation as captain and his retirement from international cricket. Of all the high-profile departures from the game in  Zimbabwe, none were felt so deeply as Taibu - a home-grown product,  a world-class wicketkeeper-batsman, and the country's first black captain.   "", ""After spells in Bangladesh and England, he moved to South Africa later in 2006 and made clear his intention to sit out the four-year qualification to try to play international cricket for them.  But it didn't work out, and to more than a few raised eyebrows he reappeared in Zimbabwe colours in mid 2007."", 'Taibu announced his retirement from international cricket in July 2012, aged 29 years, after a topsy-turvy career spanning more than a decade.

That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering. \n"", ""Reverse-sweeps aside, Williams has other shots too, and plays them often. His precocious talent was apparent while he was still a teenager. He was expected to be called up at the time of the players' strike in April 2004, but his father Collin, a former first-class player and national hockey coach, refused to release him and insisted his son should concentrate more on his studies. Almost a year later, and with just one first-class match under his belt, he was drafted into the Zimbabwe squad to tour South Africa. Although he led the U-19 side in the World Cup in Sri Lanka in February 2006 - the highlight being a win over England - there were rumours both before and after the tournament that he was not happy with the board. This turned out to be true when he turned down a central contract the following month, opting to look for a more settled career overseas. He changed his mind three months later, however, returning to play for Zimbabwe. The on-off farrago resurfaced in 2008 when he again quit for a contract in South Africa, only to return weeks later. "", ""One feels that disciplinary issues, whether perceived or actual, are never far away with Williams, who often speaks in as forthright a manner as he bats. He is one of Zimbabwe's best players of spin but was was not considered for selection for Zimbabwe's tour of Bangladesh in late 2014 after interruptions in his involvement in a training camp and an aborted disciplinary hearing. Williams responded to his omission with two centuries, a 96 and 10 wickets for Tuskers while Zimbabwe were away, underlining just what they were missing. If he is managed well Williams has the potential to be an all-round match-winner for Zimbabwe. He has a more-than-useful second string as a left-arm spinner and a keen cricketing brain, having captained Zimbabwe Under-19 and Matabeleland Tuskers on occasion."", '\n']",[],10.0,20,0,553,119,27.65,1012,54.64,1,2,71,1,9.0,0.0,122.0,118,16,3395,129*,33.28,4179,81.23,2,29,277,34,43.0,0.0,26.0,26,2,563,58*,23.45,459,122.65,0,3,52,11,11.0,0.0,60.0,109,6,4357,178,42.3,,,11,22,,,57.0,0.0,198.0,185,23,5048,129*,31.16,,,5,34,,,74.0,0.0,54.0,53,11,904,58*,21.52,795,113.71,0,3,86,12,25.0,0.0,10.0,16,1483,772,17,Mar-20,6/111,45.41,3.12,87.2,0,0,0,122.0,98,3672,3008,60,Mar-15,Mar-15,50.13,4.91,61.2,0,0,0,26.0,25,486,585,19,Mar-15,Mar-15,30.78,7.22,25.5,0,0,0,60.0,,4731,2331,67,May-36,,34.79,2.95,70.6,2,1,0,198.0,,6264,4916,125,Jul-25,Jul-25,39.32,4.7,50.1,2,1,0,54.0,50,858,1010,37,Mar-15,Mar-15,27.29,7.06,23.1,0,0,0

He overshadowed that knock during New Zealand's tour of Zimbabwe in October-November 2011, when he slammed 99 not out off 74 balls to help Zimbabwe chase down a record 329 runs in a dramatic last-over finish.

But his bulk - he conservatively tops the scales at 20 stones (280lbs) - often overshadows his accuracy and penetration.  On Bermuda's Intercontinental Cup debut in USA he took 7 for 57 in a losing cause. A year later he grabbed 11 for 72 in the same competition against the Cayman Islands.  He was just much an asset in the one-day game, although that had to be offset against his fielding which was, when Bermuda did  not need a slip, a real liability. His batting was not much better, and while he could  thump the ball, he was almost always restricted to singles, regardless of where the ball was hit. He played a key role in Bermuda qualifying for the 2007 World Cup by taking 4 for 39 against the USA and 3 for 34 against the USA in the 2005 ICC Trophy.  In that tournament he was reduced to a peripheral figure, although off the pitch he acquired cult status, and his remarkable one-handed diving catch against India, and the seismograph-breaking celebratory run which followed, delighted picture editors across the globe.

But while his ability is there for all to see, he has too often been let down by a less-than-professional attitude off the field. In 2005 he was handed a two-year suspended ban after reportedly punching an opponent during Bermuda's Cup Match, the biggest game of the year.

There was never any doubt about the fast bowler's talent. Taylor is a natural in getting the ball to move away and, when at his best, he drew comparisons with West Indies legend Michael Holding. Injuries, however, had a knack of dragging him down. \n"", ""In a five-year stretch between November 2009 and June 2014, Taylor was able to play only five T20Is and four ODIs, and had his commitment questioned by the WICB. Just before that tough period, he had spearheaded one of West Indies' greatest Test wins, at his home ground in Kingston, by ripping through England with a match haul of 8 for 85. He eventually regained his place in the team for a tour of India in 2014 - which the players abandoned due to a payment dispute with their cricket board - and has been a regular fixture in Tests and ODIs since then."", ""Taylor's rise to international cricket was rapid. He was named the most promising fast bowler in the 2003 Carib Beer Series, after picking up 21 wickets at 20.14 in six first-class matches. That haul included a second-innings 8 for 59 in Jamaica's five-wicket victory over Trinidad & Tobago, a match in which he took ten wickets for the first time. But a back injury sidelined him from competitive cricket."", ""He picked up 26 wickets at 16.61 in the Carib Beer Cup in the 2004-05 season, and in the next, he grabbed 12 wickets at 29 to force his way back into the West Indies team. When India toured the West Indies in mid-2006, they ran into an energised Taylor at his best. Quick and accurate, Taylor turned into West Indies' spearhead as the series progressed. His pacy burst on the lifeless surface in St Kitts won many admirers, but it was his lethal performance in Kingston that underlined his worth. Getting the ball to lift off a good length, he thrilled his home crowd with his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests."", ""He picked up 26 wickets at 27.69 in the 2006-07 season and bagged his then career-best figures in ODIs - 4 for 49, including a hat-trick, when he bowled West Indies to a thrilling win against Australia in the Champions Trophy. He bettered that a year later when he snared 5 for 48 against Zimbabwe, and in 2008 was West Indies' leading bowler in the Test series against Sri Lanka, with 11 wickets in two matches at 24.81. That helped him bag the Jamaica Cricketer-of-the-Year award for 2008. That year he also blitzed a Test century at just under a run a ball, from No. 8, against New Zealand. "", ""Form on his comeback after back injury in 2014 fuelled his 2015 World Cup dream, where he was West Indies' highest wicket-taker with 17 scalps in seven matches. He was also part of West Indies' World T20 winning squad in 2016. But an unsuccessful run in the longest format in Australia in December 2015-January 2016, when he picked up two wickets in three Tests, resulted in him calling time on his Test career in July 2016.""]",[],46.0,73,7,856,106,12.96,1368,62.57,1,1,116,19,8.0,0.0,90.0,42,9,278,43*,8.42,323,86.06,0,0,31,5,20.0,0.0,30.0,15,6,118,21,13.11,92,128.26,0,0,10,6,9.0,0.0,103.0,161,25,1595,106,11.72,,,1,1,,,25.0,0.0,135.0,68,17,518,43*,10.15,,,0,0,,,27.0,0.0,101.0,41,19,228,21,10.36,194,117.52,0,0,16,12,20.0,0.0,46.0,78,7757,4480,130,Jun-47,Sep-95,34.46,3.46,59.6,5,4,0,90.0,88,4341,3780,128,May-48,May-48,29.53,5.22,33.9,3,1,0,30.0,30,600,863,33,03-Jun,03-Jun,26.15,8.63,18.1,0,0,0,103.0,,15824,8401,326,Aug-59,,25.76,3.18,48.5,12,16,2,135.0,,6431,5414,203,May-40,May-40,26.66,5.05,31.6,5,2,0,101.0,100,2152,2952,126,05-Oct,05-Oct,23.42,8.23,17,2,2,0

He began at Canterbury as a no-account batsman and the most parsimonious of medium-paced bowlers, but his batting developed quickly. After becoming a free-scoring one-day player Astle was turned by the national coach Glenn Turner into a first-rate Test top-order batsman, with consecutive hundreds in West Indies in 1995-96. He ripped up the record books with his 222 against England, at Christchurch in 2001-02, which was the fastest double century in Tests, coming up off only 153 balls. A knee injury forced him out of action towards the end of 2003, but he was picked for the tour of England in 2004. Astle is now an assured batsman in both games, an expert slip-catcher, and an occasional medium-pace partnership-breaker. He may be a certain selection, but his laid-back attitude means he has never been considered for the captaincy, despite his seniority. His 10th Test match century was made against Sri Lanka in April 2005, followed soon after by his 11th.  And in September, he became only the tenth man to score 15 ODI centuries, arguably becoming New Zealand's greatest one-day player. In 2006 he signed for Lancashire, although he wasn't at his ballistic best.

Ironically, his only world record was as a batsman when he took 101 minutes over a runless innings. But Allott also had a starring role as a left-arm medium-fast bowler in the 1999 World Cup, setting a new record of 20 wickets in the seamer-friendly competition, a figure later equalled by Shane Warne from one extra match.

Cricket, though, was his calling. He lived in a neighborhood which included eventual New Zealand team-mates Kane Williamson and Doug Bracewell, and had the backing of a supportive household that also kept him grounded.', '\nSigns of his skill were evident even as a teenager. As a 17-year old, he was named the fastest secondary school bowler in the country. A year later, he was representing New Zealand at the Under-19 World Cup.', ""\nThe transition to senior cricket, though, was not quite seamless. Boult suffered a stress fracture of the back in 2009 which put him out of cricket for two years and taught him to concentrate on strength and conditioning. There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark. He became one of New Zealand's irreplaceable players across formats and one of many protagonists in the side's march to their first World Cup final in 2015. "", ""\nBoult had a tough time breaking into the limited-overs sides at first, due to a perception that he doesn't move the white ball as much as the red one. But his effectiveness in Test cricket was too compelling to ignore: he raced past 100 wickets in his 29th match and in 2013, only two years since his debut, he was New Zealand's top-wicket taker. With Brendon McCullum placing a high premium on attacking cricket in the shorter versions as well and Boult proving himself as a bowler who preferred getting batsmen out rather than keeping them quiet, it was a perfect fit. Confirmation came in World Cup 2015 when he ended up the joint-leading wicket taker with 22 scalps in nine matches including 5 for 27 in an epic victory over Australia. His worth in T20 cricket was emphasised by a (approximately) $600,000 payday in the IPL."", '\nBoult\'s strength, according to Northern Districts coach John Pamment, is that, ""he\'s got a lovely wrist position and the fact that the wrist goes right behind the ball gives him that control."" Another asset for Boult is friend and sounding board Tim Southee. When on song, their partnership makes for compelling viewing, not to mention telling numbers. In 2014, the pair picked up nearly half the wickets New Zealand took - 67 of 143 - en route to the side\'s most successful Test year, with five wins in nine matches. Boult is also among the few fast bowlers who are exceptional fielders, and has a particular knack for one-handed blinders.', '\n']",['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year - 2015'],61.0,76,37,562,52*,14.41,1063,52.86,0,1,56,25,36.0,0.0,79.0,35,20,144,21*,9.6,190,75.78,0,0,13,6,23.0,0.0,25.0,7,3,14,5,3.5,24,58.33,0,0,0,0,12.0,0.0,94.0,116,47,970,61,14.05,1912,50.73,0,2,105,39,51.0,0.0,108.0,49,25,199,21*,8.29,269,73.97,0,0,17,6,33.0,0.0,88.0,19,11,36,5*,4.5,59,61.01,0,0,0,0,39.0,0.0,61.0,115,13591,6776,246,Jun-30,Oct-80,27.54,2.99,55.2,13,8,1,79.0,79,4290,3632,147,Jul-34,Jul-34,24.7,5.07,29.1,5,5,0,25.0,25,551,784,37,Apr-34,Apr-34,21.18,8.53,14.8,1,0,0,94.0,169,19213,9437,354,Jun-30,Oct-80,26.65,2.94,54.2,15,16,1,108.0,106,5729,4861,189,Jul-34,Jul-34,25.71,5.09,30.3,7,5,0,88.0,88,1895,2651,98,Apr-34,Apr-34,27.05,8.39,19.3,1,0,0

Bond was New Zealand's best pace bowler in the post-Hadlee era, but missed more games than he played.  \n"", ""At times it seemed less like injuries interrupting Bond's career as Bond's occasional cricket matches interrupting his downtime. The most serious was a back problem in 2003 that led to nearly two years out and an operation in which his spine was fused with titanium wire. There were also various issues with knees, feet and other body parts, but Bond's desire to play could never be questioned. Some of the trouble came from his unwillingness to reduce his intensity; had he been happy to drop his pace and take things easier, he might have played more cricket. "", ""That he didn't take that path said much about his competitive nature; the game always lifted a notch when he had the ball. His athletic action was geared towards inswing and his 150-plus kph efforts meant the ball would swing late. Toe-crushing yorkers were a specialty and he feasted on the world's best batsmen; Ricky Ponting fell to Bond in all of the first six ODIs they played against each other. Bond always lifted against Australia, and it was a sign of his great skill that he took 44 ODI wickets at 15.79 against them. That included a hat-trick in Hobart in 2006-07 and one of Bond's personal favourites, his 6 for 23 against the eventual champions in the 2003 World Cup.

Unsurprisingly, his first international foray was in the T20 format. Having earned a reputation as a heavy hitter in New Zealand's domestic T20 competition, de Grandhomme earned a debut against his native Zimbabwe in 2012. He did not sufficiently impress to keep his place on that occasion, but continued to flourish on the domestic circuit.  \n"", ""In 2016, an unbeaten fourth-innings 144 off 147 balls, to lead Auckland's successful chase of 373, put him back into national reckoning, this time in the Test format.

A steady show in 2010-11 - during which he was part of the Auckland side that won the domestic one-day tournament and wrested the Twenty20 title from Central Districts - resulted in another call-up to the New Zealand Emerging Players team in 2011.

He was introduced to international cricket when barely out of his teens after New Zealand suffered a run of injuries, making his one-day debut in 2000-01 and playing two home Tests against Pakistan the same season, but he struggled to make an impact and lost his place after the Sharjah Cup in April 2002. Back in domestic cricket he worked on his batting, which he had neglected, and filled out generally.  \n', 'He returned to the side in England in 2004. He was playing league cricket in Lancashire, but was called up when Shane Bond went home with a back injury. Franklin was included for the third Test at Trent Bridge, and although New Zealand lost he did his cause no harm with six wickets, five of them Test century-makers. He stayed on for the one-dayers that followed, and picked up the match award at Chester-le-Street for his 5 for 42 as England were skittled for 101. ', ""He was retained for the tour of Bangladesh, and took a hat-trick at Dhaka. Back home he took 6 for 119 against Australia in March 2005, and bowled superbly - getting the ball to reverse-swing - against Sri Lanka a month later, although his figures didn't reflect his excellence. More wickets followed against West Indies, then in April 2006 Franklin did his allrounder claims no harm with an unbeaten 122 - and a stand of 256 with Stephen Fleming - against South Africa at Cape Town."", ""A knee injury hampered his 2006-07 season and he underwent surgery for a patella tendon injury in his right knee. Franklin eased back into competitive cricket by playing Twenty20 and one-day games for Australian Capital Territory and representing New Zealand in the Emerging Players tour of Queensland in October 2008. He made his first-class comeback for Wellington in November with 69 and 4 for 56 in his team's innings victory over Canterbury."", 'He returned to the international team later the same year but struggled to nail down a permanent place, despite performing strongly in county cricket for Gloucestershire in 2009 and 2010. He was part of the New Zealand side that made it to the semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup and expressed his disappointment at missing out on a central contract, though he regained a deal the following year. By this point, Franklin had developed into an allrounder capable of scoring useful runs down the order and bowling economical spells and he remains a fixture in the T20 and ODI teams, although a Test return was less successful.', ""Middlesex signed Franklin in 2015 as an on-overseas player thanks to his Irish ancestry, effectively bringing about his retirement from international cricket. Adam Voges' call-up by Australia meant that he soon assumed the captaincy, a role he held when Middlesex won their first title for 23 years in 2016 - the title settled on the final afternoon in a contrived declaration against Yorkshire with the prize of the Championship to the winners.

During his last innings, in Napier, he did just enough to lift his career average over 40. Nine Test centuries is a poor return for such a talent, but Fleming was worth more than his statistics. \n"", ""A stint with Middlesex in 2001 laid the foundations for a successful re-evaluation of his batting methods where the inability to convert half-centuries to centuries did no justice to his quality.

He followed that with an equally impressive 192 at Hamilton against Pakistan later that year and was named New Zealand's cricketer of the year in 2004."", ""The date 26 October, 2004 will remain in Fleming's memory, as he gained three New Zealand Test records in facing the Bangladesh attack at Chittagong. Firstly, his 87th Test earned him the record for most caps won by a New Zealander and, in striding to the crease for the 150th time, this was the greatest number of Test innings for New Zealand. And, as he moved to 81, in an innings where he would strike 202, he surpassed Martin Crowe's record aggregate of 5444 runs in Tests for New Zealand. He launched his first book, "", "" in December 2004 and, in the following season, captained Nottinghamshire to their first county title since 1987. He had a benign tumour removed from his face in December 2005, during Australia's one-day tour of New Zealand."", ""The following May he made his 100th Test appearance, against South Africa - appropriately at Centurion - although failed to mark the occasion with an innings of substance. A wonderful 262 followed at Cape Town but New Zealand were unable to win the match. The World Cup in the West Indies was Fleming's fourth as a player and third as captain and he led New Zealand to another semi-final. That was his final act as one-day skipper, though, as he announced he was standing down from that half of his role but wanted to continue leading the Test side. He spent the off-season playing at Nottinghamshire and dodging questions about whether he would join the Indian Cricket League. In September he announced he would stay on as a New Zealand Test player but retired from ODIs, and at the same time was relieved of the Test captaincy after a decade in charge, in favour of Daniel Vettori. However, after being tempted by the Indian Premier League he announced his international retirement and the series against England was his last.\n"", '\n', ' March 2008']",[],111.0,189,10,7172,274*,40.06,15652,45.82,9,46,917,26,171.0,0.0,280.0,269,21,8037,134*,32.4,11242,71.49,8,49,823,63,133.0,0.0,5.0,5,0,110,38,22,85,129.41,0,0,20,0,2.0,0.0,247.0,406,32,16409,274*,43.87,,,35,93,,,340.0,0.0,460.0,437,38,14019,139*,35.13,,,22,86,,,225.0,0.0,53.0,53,3,1157,64*,23.14,949,121.91,0,6,156,22,13,0,111.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,280.0,3,29,28,1,01-Aug,01-Aug,28,5.79,29,0,0,0,5.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,247.0,,102,129,0,-,-,-,7.58,-,0,0,0,460.0,,35,31,2,01-Mar,01-Mar,15.5,5.31,17.5,0,0,0,53.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Harris's ability to score all round the wicket, pick the gaps and hit boundaries at just the right time turned him into New Zealand's answer to Michael Bevan, and his 62 not-outs in one-day cricket testify to his ability to close out an innings. His bowling was ideally suited to the shorter game - a gentle medium-pace that forces the batsman to do all the work allied to subtle changes in pace and the ability to cut the ball either way off the wicket. Harris was also a very safe fielder, particularly within the inner circle and in the covers. He hit a purple patch with the bat in late 1997, going 19 consecutive innings (eight of them in ODIs)  without being dismissed and registering three half-centuries. He also played a vital role in New Zealand's triumph at the ICC KnockOut tournament, putting together a partnership of 122 for the sixth wicket with Chris Cairns to set up a last-over win against India in the final. But, again like Bevan, Harris was unable to carry his undeniable talent into Test cricket and his 23 appearances between 1992 and 2002 resulted in a disappointing batting average of 20.44 and an untenable bowling average of 73.12. In 2004, Harris became the first New Zealand player to have played 250 ODIs, although a shoulder injury marred his 250th, and final, appearance. He also remains New Zealand's second-highest wicket-taker in one-dayers, behind Daniel Vettori. At the age of 40 Harris remains an effective player for Canterbury in domestic cricket, although retirement cannot be far away.

He opened the batting for his province Northern Districts until 2004-05, and it is at the top of the order that he has had his major successes at first-class level since he made his debut in 1997-98. But it was as a middle-order player that he made his one-day international debut for New Zealand against Australia in February 2005. Just weeks later he was called into the team for the third Test against Australia - but this time as an opener. His twin brother Hamish played both matches. \n', ""When Marshall made his Test debut, he had a batting average of 28.70, but he was picked on potential rather than his track record, the same as Hamish. Technique was also a major factor in the New Zealand selectors' decision to ask him to open once again. But his lack of runs led to him losing his national contract in 2006, although later the same year he made his first ODI half-century against Sri Lanka in Queenstown. He concentrated on Northern Districts and captained the team to its fifth State Championship title in 2006-07. New Zealand's top-order struggles allowed him to regain his contract and earn a place on the tour of England in 2008, following a strong 2007-08 domestic season during which he scored 616 first-class runs at 51.33. Marshall raised hopes that he might be able to fill the bothersome Test No. 3 spot after an attractive century against Essex, but as in his previous outings at Test level struggled against the swing.

A stylish middle-order batsman, he played 13 Tests and 66 ODIs for New Zealand and made three centuries. But turned his back on international cricket in 2007-08 to play county cricket for Gloucestershire and spent 11 seasons in the West Country before returning home to play for Wellington, at 37, the city in which his career had begun. He enjoyed a steady county career without lighting up the English game that his early promise suggested was possible. \n', 'The 146 he made against Australia in March 2005 proved the high point in his career, not the beginning of greatness some foresaw. He was unshakable against the pace of the mighty Australians at their peak. Another big hundred followed against Sri Lanka and a year later he was signed by Gloucestershire as their overseas player. The cosy life in county cricket proved too attractive and Marshall rejected a central contract for 2007-08, eventually becoming a home-qualified player for Gloucestershire via an Irish passport.', 'It was a disappointment for New Zealand, who first picked Marshall in December 2000 for a Test debut against South Africa. Batting at No. 7 he made an unbeaten 40, showing great maturity and promise. But he was not picked again and had to wait for another three years to get his chance when he was called up for the one-day series in Pakistan in 2003-04. In his third game, he scored an impressive 101 not out in Faisalabad, and later scored 64 and 84 to help New Zealand win the corresponding home series. He then helped New Zealand to win the 2003-04 home one-day series against South Africa, and was called up for the 2004 NatWest Series in England, scoring 75 not out and 55 in the group matches before a solid 44 saw New Zealand win the final against West Indies. ', ""Marshall struggled to hold down a place in New Zealand's ODI side through 2006-07 and although he was not picked in the World Cup squad, he later joined the team as a replacement when Lou Vincent broke his wrist. Marshall played three games in the Caribbean but then sprung a surprise by refusing a national contract."", 'His career with Gloucestershire began as an overseas player in 2006 where he scored 102 against Worcestershire on début and finished the season with 1218 runs at 60.90. That year he also made his highest score for the county, 168 against Leicestershire at Cheltenham. But since making the move permanent he has failed to match that mark and suffered a torrid 2011 season, making only 401 runs in 19 innings. He bounced back to an extent with his first century for three years in 2012 and managed to average 37.36 in a horrendously wet season. He, like many, found the going far easier in 2013 and made over 1000 runs in a season for just the second time in his career, including four centuries, but slipped back in the following season. ', 'The arrival of Richard Dawson as coach was good for him, evidenced by his four Championship hundreds in his farewell Championship summer in 2016. He ended 11 seasons emotionally with a pugnacious 70-odd at Bristol, boosting his career tally to 14,286 runs including 30 centuries.', ""His undoubted highlight in limited-overs cricket was winning the Royal London Cup final against Surrey in 2015, Gloucestershire's first trophy in over a decade. In 2011, along with Kevin O'Brien, he played in the first T20 innings where two players scored centuries; Gloucestershire's 254 for 3 against Middlesex at Uxbridge broke the domestic T20 world record."", 'Marshall also played in the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2008 for the Royal Bengal Tigers.

It was quite a shift after McMillan was dumped at the end of 2005 and began looking for other employment opportunities - including as a salesman. But he regained his limited-overs place for the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 and strong performances at the CB Series in Australia, followed by a New Zealand record 67-ball ODI century in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, ensured his ticket to the World Cup. McMillan impressed with bat and ball in his comeback, which was timely as New Zealand searched for all-round options with injuries to the likes of Scott Styris and Jacob Oram. McMillan, a player who had been gifted international selection from the age of 21, began his career productively and in March 2001 he took a world record 26 runs off one Younis Khan over in a Test against Pakistan at Hamilton. His destructive batting perhaps promised more than he delivered, however, and he was forced to test his resolve when overlooked for a tour of Sri Lanka in 2003. McMillan returned with 83 not out and an unbeaten century in India in 2003-04 to cement his Test spot but 18 months later lost it again and was views as purely a limited-overs option. His World Cup was useful without being outstanding but he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer at the ICC World Twenty20. It was to be his final international tournament, as he announced his retirement at the age of 31 in October 2007. He joined the ICL soon after, captained the Royal Bengal Tigers, quit the league in 2009 and signed a one-year contract with Canterbury.

And he reprised that style in Tests too - striking the fastest century in the format's history in his final match.  \n"", 'He also became the second man, after Chris Gayle, to score a Twenty20 international century when he brazenly scooped 155kph offerings from Shaun Tait and Dirk Nannes over the wicketkeeper\'s head in Christchurch in 2009-10. McCullum describes himself as ""brash"" and that innings was the proof, but he has also been a key part of New Zealand\'s Test team since 2004. In the longer format he began his career at No. 7 and in his second series, entertained the crowd with 96 at Lord\'s.', 'He notched up five of his first six Test centuries in that position, but later in his career he also showed he had another gear and could bat according to the needs of the team: against India in Wellington in 2014, he compiled a monumental 302 in 775 minutes, the eighth-longest innings at the time in terms of minutes. It saved New Zealand the Test from a hopeless position, and McCullum became the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple-hundred.', ""Although Adam Parore's Test mark of 201 dismissals was within his reach, McCullum shunned the wicketkeeper's gloves when he took over as captain in all formats at the end of 2012. His succession was anything but smooth, with Ross Taylor opting out of New Zealand's subsequent tour of South Africa after being replaced in controversial circumstances. However, McCullum slowly moulded New Zealand into a terrific - and hugely popular - team in all formats, not only in terms of their results but also in the manner in which they played the game: attacking with both bat and ball, but without any of the sledging and needless aggression that is often a part of other teams. Under him, New Zealand reached the World Cup final for the first time, in 2015, and went 13 consecutive home Tests without a defeat."", 'At the end of 2015, McCullum announced that the home Test series against Australia would be his last international fixtures. He became the first player to play 100 consecutive Tests from his debut.', ' ']","['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year - 2008, 2015', 'ICC Twenty20 International Performance of the Year - 2010', 'ICC Spirit of Cricket Award - 2015']",101.0,176,9,6453,302,38.64,9989,64.6,12,31,776,107,198.0,11.0,260.0,228,28,6083,166,30.41,6312,96.37,5,32,577,200,262.0,15.0,71.0,70,10,2140,123,35.66,1571,136.21,2,13,199,91,36.0,8.0,150.0,261,13,9210,302,37.13,,,17,46,,,308.0,19.0,309.0,271,32,7373,170,30.84,,,9,37,,,305.0,17.0,370.0,364,33,9922,158*,29.97,7269,136.49,7,55,924,485,153,14,101.0,8,175,88,1,01-Jan,Jan-13,88,3.01,175,0,0,0,260.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,71.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,150.0,,259,140,1,01-Jan,Jan-13,140,3.24,259,0,0,0,309.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,370.0,1,6,13,0,-,-,-,13,-,0,0,0

He took 16 wickets in six List A matches that season, and 35 in ten first-class games.

He kept up the frenetic rate of wicket-taking, and in October 2014 became the fastest New Zealand bowler - and the joint second-fastest from anywhere - to 50 ODI wickets, getting to the mark in only his 23rd match. By then he had become an important part of New Zealand's ODI attack, used in short, sharp bursts by captain Brendon McCullum and told to chase wickets rather than worrying about his economy rate."", ""McClenaghan was part of New Zealand's squad at the 2015 World Cup, but the depth of the team's pace resources only allowed him one match during their surge to the final. The boot was on the other foot a year later at the 2016 World T20, when Tim Southee and Trent Boult did not feature even once, but McClenaghan, preferred for his ability to bowl cutters on the slower Indian surfaces, played an important role in their run to the semi-finals."", 'Mumbai Indians landed a bargain when they picked up McClenaghan for INR 30 lakh at the 2015 IPL auction. He had an excellent debut season for the eventual champions, taking 18 wickets at an average of 21.44, including a three-for in the final against Chennai Super Kings.

He has a high degree of agility in the field, where his skills were developed as a schoolboy representative soccer goalkeeper, and he complements that with solid medium-fast bowling skills and a naturally aggressive approach with the bat. Foot problems during the summer of 2001-02 meant he missed a season at a vital stage of his development, but he came back strongly in 2002-03 and sealed a place for himself in both the Test and one-day international sides. In 2003-04, he narrowly missed out on a century, as he struck 97 against Pakistan. But in the first Test against South Africa, he carved 119 not out and then 90 in the second Test, which earned him a touring spot for the England series in 2004. Oram continued to acquit himself well, and maintained his place for the Bangladesh tour in 2004-05. After suffering a stress reaction to a back injury, he missed Australia's tour of New Zealand in 2005 but returned to hit a delightful hundred, his third in Tests, against South Africa at Centurion in April 2006. His one-day game peaked at the CB Series in 2006-07, where his impressive striking rattled both England and Australia. His first ODI century, an amazing 101 from 72 balls against Australia, almost got New Zealand over the line in a huge run-chase at Perth. He broke the ring finger on his left hand taking a catch on the boundary in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series soon after but made it to the World Cup. His comment that he would 'chop off his finger' to play sparked frenzied reaction in the media but was meant in jest and he went on to average 33 with the bat and 25 with the ball as New Zealand reached the semi-finals.

He impressed in the one-dayers, and was duly selected for the corresponding Test series. He made 59 on his debut, but struggled afterwards. Nevertheless, the selectors kept faith, and picked him to tour England in 2004. An injury to Craig McMillan handed him a spot in the second Test at Headingley. He scored a battling 86, opening in difficult conditions, but at some price: he broke a finger, and was forced to bat down the order in the second innings as New Zealand sunk to a series defeat.

His first international incarnation came for Australia in the West Indies in 2008 when he stood in for the injured Brad Haddin in four ODIs and a Twenty20 and he showed he was not out of his depth: his glovework was brilliant and at the tiny Warner Park in St Kitts he clubbed a 22-ball half-century, then the equal third-quickest ODI fifty scored by an Australia player. But his form fell away during the following domestic summer and he added only one more T20 international to his tally for Australia. By the end of 2008-09 his runs had dried up so severely that he had even been dropped by Western Australia and his future appeared bleak. \n', '\nOver the next few seasons, Ronchi was there and thereabouts in state cricket but he was overtaken by Graham Manou, Tim Paine and Matthew Wade in the queue behind Haddin. At the end of 2011-12, he decided to try his luck in his country of birth and secured a contract with Wellington. His performances were strong enough to earn him a call-up to the New Zealand ODI side once he had qualified in 2013 and against England in May he debuted, becoming the first man since Kepler Wessels nearly 20 years earlier to represent two full ICC member nations.', '\nAs New Zealand rode an ODI wave that eventually culminated with defeat at the final of the 2015 World Cup, Ronchi made a decent case for himself as a lower-order batsman. He smashed 170 off 99 balls against Sri Lanka in Dunedin in 2014, then the highest score ever by a No. 7 batsman and, in May 2015, seven years after making his international debut, Ronchi earned his maiden Test cap. A half-century in the first innings at Headingley helped his side level a two-match series against England 1-1. Ronchi played three more Tests, two World T20s and two Champions Trophies before calling time on his international career in June 2017. ', ""\nHe had moved with his family to Perth at the age of seven and debuted for Western Australia in 2001-02. He established himself as a solid gloveman and clean striker of the ball and in 2006-07 he made his mark with the then fastest century in Australian domestic one-day history. His 56-ball ton against New South Wales featured a series of powerful pulls off Stuart Clark, and it eclipsed the 62-ball record set by Ronchi's team-mate Adam Voges two seasons earlier. "", '\nAnother standout moment was when he struck 89 from 49 balls against an England XI in the Lilac Hill match the same summer. Perhaps his most remarkable display was in a 2007-08 Pura Cup match against Queensland when he scored a 51-ball century, with the second fifty coming in a scarcely believable 11 deliveries. At that stage Australia were keen to call Ronchi their own, but several years later New Zealand were equally pleased to claim his services.']",[],4.0,8,0,319,88,39.87,432,73.84,0,2,41,6,5.0,0.0,85.0,68,9,1397,170*,23.67,1220,114.5,1,4,149,43,105.0,12.0,33.0,26,6,359,51*,17.95,256,140.23,0,1,30,14,24.0,6.0,100.0,158,15,5614,148,39.25,6685,83.97,16,23,,,343.0,17.0,190.0,171,20,4194,170*,27.77,3919,107.01,7,21,,,249.0,32.0,196.0,180,20,3951,102,24.69,2577,153.31,1,23,391,184,114,34,4.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,85.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,33.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,100.0,,30,12,0,-,-,-,2.4,-,0,0,0,190.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,196.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

He had nearly 10 years of domestic cricket before he was called up to the Test squad, having made his one-day international debut much earlier. Originally a seamer, a knee injury forced him to take his batting more seriously, and he switched from being a bowler who can bat into being a batsman who occasionally bowls. He was awarded his Test cap on the eve of the Karachi Test in May 2002, only for it to be taken back when the match was cancelled as a result of a bomb blast. When he finally got the chance he scored a century and a half-century on debut against West Indies. On the same tour of the Caribbean he broke the New Zealand record for one-day bowling with 6 for 25 in Trinidad.  He has been encouraged by John Bracewell to work on his offspin as an option which would put less strain on his body, but this has yet to be unveiled. Having spent the best part of 11 years with Northern Districts, Styris signed for Auckland - and in 2005 was tempted by Middlesex for a stint in the county game. He continued a strong link with English cricket, taking up a mid-season contract with Durham in 2007. A thrilling 101 in New Zealand's chase of a then-record 322 against Australia at Christchurch was followed by useful contributions in the one-day series against West Indies at home. A timely unbeaten 103 on and some key wickets on the first day at Auckland saw New Zealand take a series lead in the Tests. A back injury ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka in December 2006 but he returned in time for the last few games of the tri-series in Australia and was considered fit enough to be named in the 15-man World Cup squad where he was one of the leading performers with 499 runs at 83. After a poor Test series against South Africa in November 2007, he was dropped from the Test side for the home series against Bangladesh.

In only his third match, Taylor hammered a superb 128 against Sri Lanka at Napier and he followed it up with 84 at better than a run a ball in his first ODI outside New Zealand, at Hobart against Australia in January 2007. But in both matches he suffered from cramps and would be keen to eradicate that problem as he strives for more lengthy innings. He scores heavily from the pull and from slog-sweeping the spinners and his free-flowing game has made him a hit with crowds. There was evidence of that during the IPL and Champions League  when the Bangalore crowds cheered him as their 'local' hero.  \n"", ""Given New Zealand's lack of Tests it wasn't until the 2007-08 tour of South Africa that Taylor made his debut and he struggled against the extra bounce. Back at home he was dropped against Bangladesh, but return in style against England with his maiden century, 120, at Hamilton and then followed that with a memorable 154 at Old Trafford, confirming he now carries New Zealand's batting hopes. A leadership role wasn't too far away and he was named captain for the tri-series in Sri Lanka in 2010 after Vettori and McCullum opted out."", 'However, Taylor\'s two-year captaincy stint ended in controversy when it emerged that he and Mike Hesson, the coach who took over from John Wright, didn\'t have a comfortable relationship. During Taylor\'s 13-Test captaincy stint New Zealand notched up rare wins in Australia and Sri Lanka, but immediately after the Sri Lanka tour he stepped down in controversial circumstances, as Brendon McCullum was named captain in all formats. After deciding not to tour South Africa, he returned for New Zealand\'s home series against England, admitting that his relationship with Hesson was still a ""work in progress"".\n', ' ']",['New Zealand Cricket Almanack Player of the Year 2009'],92.0,163,19,6727,290,46.71,11169,60.22,18,30,824,49,134.0,0.0,218.0,203,37,8026,181*,48.34,9626,83.37,20,47,665,138,137.0,0.0,88.0,80,19,1579,63,25.88,1304,121.08,0,5,100,59,44.0,0.0,167.0,281,22,11214,290,43.29,,,26,59,,,209.0,0.0,278.0,263,42,10240,181*,46.33,,,24,65,,,178.0,0.0,261.0,245,61,5810,111*,31.57,4376,132.76,1,29,400,281,114,0,92.0,7,96,48,2,02-Apr,02-Apr,24,3,48,0,0,0,218.0,4,42,35,0,-,-,-,5,-,0,0,0,88.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,167.0,,684,378,6,02-Apr,02-Apr,63,3.31,114,0,0,0,278.0,,318,242,3,Jan-13,Jan-13,80.66,4.56,106,0,0,0,261.0,15,186,280,8,Mar-28,Mar-28,35,9.03,23.2,0,0,0

He struggled to live up to those early expectations, played only 23 Tests, and in 2014 was banned for life by the ECB for breaching their anti-corruption regulations.    \n"", 'Vincent played his last international match in 2007, but his career low came after that, when he was involved with bookmakers during the England county season. Vincent later pleaded guilty to these charges, which referred to three matches during the 2008 and 2011 season, and also to a CLT20 match in 2012. ', ""In the early part of his career, though, Vincent was seen a fine batting talent. Following his outstanding Test debut in 2001-02, he wasn't always consistent, but came up with some top-class performances. A superb 224, his first Test double-century, against Sri Lanka was then followed up with a good one-day series in South Africa, in October 2005 and he returned home with his reputation intact, unlike many of his team-mates. The following season he signed for Worcestershire but he then had a disappointing Champions Trophy and was overlooked for the home Test and one-day series against Sri Lanka. "", ""When his ODI return came, as a replacement for Nathan Astle in the tri-series in Australia in early 2007, Vincent grabbed the chance with both hands and strung together innings of 66, 76 and 90. It made him New Zealand's second-highest run-scorer for the tournament, despite playing only half the games and secured his ticket to the Caribbean. He began with two ducks before finding his form with a century against Canada, but a broken wrist ended his tournament before the Super Eight stage. "", 'His career nosedived after a poor run of form during the tour of South Africa and the Chappell-Hadlee Series that followed. Dropped for the tour of Bangladesh, he admitted to suffering from depression and lost his contract with New Zealand Cricket after joining the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League.

The youngest man to play Test cricket for New Zealand, at the age of 18, he is one of only eight players to have managed the double of 300 Test wickets and 3000 runs. With time on his side, he could one day creep up towards Hadlee's 431 Test dismissals, but to do that Vettori would need to avoid the stress fractures in his back that troubled him earlier in his career. He also cannot afford another form slump like the one he suffered in 2003-04.  \n"", ""He bounced back from that one, returning to his best, and his mastery of drift and subtle variations in flight, speed and length earned him a reputation as New Zealand's most dangerous player. It was that guile and ability to confuse the batsmen that sometimes turned what seemed like innocuous deliveries into unplayable hand grenades by the time they reached the other end. "", 'He troubled Australia with 12 for 149 at Eden Park in March 2000, giving him his first ten-wicket Test.

He was recognised alongside Muttiah Muralitharan as one of the best spinners outside Australia for the Super Series in 2005-06, and was one of six players to represent the World XI in the Test and all three one-dayers. ', ""A more than handy lower-order batsman, he is the most prolific No. 8 in Tests. He was installed as captain for the Twenty20 World Championship in 2007 and took over from Fleming as the Test captain ahead of their two-Test tour of South Africa. However, retirements and the ICL saw New Zealand slip in the world rankings, and Vettori was saddled with more responsibilities than he could have imagined - including that of selector in 2009. Positive results, especially in Tests, were hard to come by but it didn't affect Vettori's form, and on many occasions his lower-order batting has come to the rescue.

Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010. \n"", "" \nWilliamson was born into a sporting family in Tauranga, the largest city in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty region. His father had played Under-17 cricket for Northern Districts, his mother was a representative basketball player, and his sisters played volleyball at age-group level. Williamson took to cricket and it grew beyond a hobby quite quickly."", ' \nHe was modest about his skills, too, - ""Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I\'m not one of them,"" - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14.

Among his best performances is his maiden Test double-century in January 2015, which helped New Zealand come from behind and beat Sri Lanka in Wellington. The innings was a testament to Williamson's hunger for runs and batting time - he was dissatisfied despite making 242 in over 10 hours."", ' \nWilliamson has made his orthodoxy work and is capable of scoring at a brisk tempo - he has a T20 hundred for Northern Knights and became the quickest New Zealand batsman, and fifth overall, to 3000 ODI runs. For a measure of his consistency, he has two streaks of five or more successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs in 20 months since 2014.', ' \nHe is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation.

He was part of the Under-19 squad for the World Cup in Bangladesh in 2003-04 before making it to the Northern Districts squad. He was the second-highest run-scorer for his state team in his third season (2006-07) with 564 runs at 37.60. He was in prime form during the one-day State Shield competition in 2008-09 with 509 runs at a stunning 63.62 and that helped him earn a place in the New Zealand one-day squad for the ODIs in the UAE against Pakistan.\n \nIn 2010, after Brendon McCullum decided to keep wicket for New Zealand only in the ODIs, Watling emerged as the best long-term prospect for New Zealand in Tests, among contenders like Gareth Hopkins, Reece Young and Kruger van Wyk. Between 2009 and 2012, he played only eight Tests - the first six as a specialist batsman - before settling into the role of New Zealand's full-time wicketkeeper for the longer format in 2013. \n \nApart from being tidy behind the stumps, Watling's batting has also been impressive. Against India in February 2014, Watling and McCullum put together a record sixth-wicket partnership of 352 in Wellington. Watling's 124 in that Test was his first century against a top-eight nation. On the tour of West Indies, Watling's battling 66 and his 99-run partnership with Mark Craig delayed a West Indies win in Port-of-Spain.

A tall offspinner, Ashwin opened the bowling for Chennai Super Kings, bowled at death, came on when wickets were required, and was the Man of the Series in the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 played in South Africa. "", ' \n', ""Ashwin's success in T20 cricket earned him a call-up to the national side - ODI firsts and inevitably the Tests in 2011-12. He was a part of the winning squad in the 2011 World Cup, but rarely got a chance ahead of Harbhajan Singh. But, Ashwin kept on building a phenomenal body of work and his rapid development as a bowler coincided with Harbhajan's fading fortunes. "", ' ', ""Ashwin took nine wickets in his maiden Test against West Indies, the second-highest by an Indian debutant after Narendra Hirwani's 16, and won the Man-of-the-Match award. It only got better from there: he registered nine five-fors in his first 16 Tests and in 2013, broke Erapalli Prasanna's Indian record for the fastest to 100 Test wickets by reaching the landmark in his 18th game. "", 'His carrom ball, an arm ball just as good, his control over his offbreaks, and a sharp brain has made Ashwin a quintessential limited-overs spinner. In Test cricket, however, he endured a brief period of struggle after not being able to replicate his success in subcontinental conditions overseas. In December 2013, Ashwin went wicketless for 36 overs in Johannesburg as India failed to bowl out South Africa, who nearly accomplished a chase of 458 in over four-and-a-half-sessions. He was made to sit out for six Tests after that, and when India went to Australia in late 2014, he was not picked for the first Test in Adelaide. ', ""Ashwin, however, effected minor tweaks to his bowling, mainly zeroing in on a comfortable action, and recaptured his glorious form to finish with 31 wickets in India's 3-0 series win against South Africa at home in November-December 2015. An opener with the bat before he took up offspin, Ashwin is more than a handy lower-order batsman: he is correct, has the shots and scored two Test centuries. He had a decent outing in the 2016 World T20, but in a crucial moment in the semi-final, he overstepped and reprieved the dangerous Lendl Simmons, paving the way for West Indies' win and India's exit.

Agarkar's entry into international cricket - with an avalanche of wickets that made him the then fastest to 50 in ODIs - was matched for speed only by an astonishing batting slump during which he collected seven consecutive Test ducks against Australia. But he could bat, because tailenders simply do not score half-centuries in 21 balls, as Agarkar did in a one-day game against Zimbabwe, or score Test centuries at Lord's, as Agarkar did in some style in 2002. His aggression was an asset, but his body could not sometimes support it.

Hailing from Jharkhand, Aaron has been part of the MRF Pace Academy in Chennai since he was spotted by a talent scout at the age of 15. However, his career has been marred with frequent injuries. Two stress fractures of the back soon after his Ranji Trophy debut in the 2008-09 season for Jharkhand, a back injury that kept him out of India's tour to Australia in 2011-12 before a recurrence kept him out of competitive cricket for 15 months, and a leg injury in 2014 has had a severe impact on the pacer's Test career. \n"", 'He was part of the India Emerging Players squad that went to Australia in 2011, and earned a call-up to the India ODI squad for the series in England.

He made his Test debut a month later, against West Indies, also in Mumbai.', ""Aaron's pace during India's tour of England in 2014 - including a sharp bouncer that broke Stuart Broad's nose - impressed county side Durham, and he was signed for the final few weeks of the season. Having earlier been part of the Kolkata Knight Riders squad, he made his IPL debut in 2011 for Delhi Daredevils. In 2014, Aaron was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore for INR 2 crore (approx. 300,000 USD), and was retained by the franchise ahead of the 2016 auction.

It would have been easy to dismiss him as a one-dimensional bowler after his forgettable debut. He erased the memories of being caned for 44 runs off his first four overs, and of two fruitless home Tests against New Zealand, when he emerged one of India's leading fast bowlers in their historic tour of Pakistan in 2003-04. He was particularly lethal in a couple of sessions in the third Test in Rawalpindi, where he consistently swung the ball away, and snapped up a then career-best 4 for 63. In addition, his uninhibited batting and a megawatt smile endeared him to crowds in a manner even he found difficult to fathom. \n"", 'That comeback fades in comparison to the one he made in 2008-09. A stress fracture ruled him out of cricket in 2005, and threatened to end his career. For three years he could hardly play any cricket. He had to undergo a back surgery before which he was not sure he would be able to bowl again. ""If I were to go back,"" WV Raman, the Tamil Nadu coach who supported him throughout the hiatus said, ""to what all happened when he was told he would have to go for a surgery, it would take me two days to rattle on."" With a remodelled action and the same unwavering spirit, he started the long road back through the first season of the IPL in 2008. His 11 wickets for Chennai Super Kings included a hat-trick. A successful Ranji season followed, and his 36 wickets at 17.50 took Tamil Nadu through to the semi-final. Eventually the national recall came, when Munaf Patel sustained a groin injury during the five-ODI series in Sri Lanka in January 2009. He then made it back to the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, but never got a game. He captained the Tamil Nadu Ranji side, and reminded the selectors yet again that he wasn\'t a finished article, by bowling economically for Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 IPL. He was rewarded with a call-up to the Twenty20 squad for the home series against New Zealand and the ICC World Twenty20. ', 'Before the injury struck he bowled with a whippy, quick-arm action and had the ability to bowl quicker deliveries, yorkers or bouncers without a perceptible change in action. His open-chested action, combined with a tendency to bowl wide from the crease, lulled batsmen into believing that the ball would come in with the arm. As a result of this, when the ball swung away, or even straightened, he could be difficult to tackle. Not much of that has changed in his remodelled action. The perceptible change is in the way he starts his run-up, where he sort of tiptoes for the first few steps - almost as if unsure of the ground he is going to run on, before easing in.

Badrinath stands tall at the crease, and plays with a correct technique. He was pitchforked into the national consciousness in 2005-06 when he nearly topped the batting charts, scoring 636 runs from seven matches at almost 80, missing pole position by 36 runs to Amol Muzumdar, who played one match more. In comparison 2006-07 was not as spectacular, but Badrinath managed 436 runs at almost 50. An excellent fielder at point, and elsewhere in the circle, Badrinath began as a grafter, something quite rare at a time when strokemakers ruled, and expanded his repertoire of strokes as he gained experience. In 2007 he piled on the runs for India A on their tours to Zimbabwe and Kenya, and in the home series against South Africa A. In October  he was called up to the ODI squad for the last three one-dayers against Australia, though he did not get a game. He was dropped for the series against Pakistan that followed.  He shrugged off the disappointment by performing well in the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy season, scoring 659 runs at 65.90. After being ignored for ten months, he was named as Sachin Tendulkar's replacement for the Sri Lanka ODIs and impressed in his first appearance, showing sound technique against the spinners to see India through to a tense win. He made it to the Test squad for Australia's 2008-09 tour of India, but didn't get his debut. However, a series of injuries to the Indian middle order handed Badri a Test debut in Nagpur more than a year later, at the age of 29.

His progress into the national side may have been steady and methodical rather than meteoric, but once there, Dravid established himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant generation that were no longer easybeats away from home. Armed with an orthodox technique drilled into him by Keki Tarapore, he became the cement that held the foundations firm while the flair players expressed themselves. Yet, for a man quickly stereotyped as one-paced and one-dimensional, he too could stroke the ball around when the mood struck him. \n', ""Never a natural athlete, he compensated with sheer hard work and powers of concentration that were almost yogic. At Adelaide in 2003, when India won a Test in Australia for the first time in a generation, he batted 835 minutes over two innings. A few months later, he was at the crease more than 12 hours for the 270 that clinched India's first series win in Pakistan.\nInitially seen as a liability in the one-day arena, he retooled his game over the years to become an adept middle-order finisher. The heaves and swipes didn't come naturally, but by the time the selectors eased him aside in early 2008, he had more than 10,000 runs to his name in the 50-over game. There had also been a lengthy phase where he donned the wicketkeeping gloves, helping the team to find a balance that was crucial in the run to the World Cup final in 2003."", ""However, it's his Test exploits that he will be most remembered for. After impressing in a Lord's debut where he was eclipsed by Sourav Ganguly, Dravid's breakthrough innings arrived at the Wanderers a few months later, against a South African attack accustomed to bullying visitors. A brief slump followed, but he emerged from that with perhaps one of the most famous supporting acts of all, to VVS Laxman in an Eden Gardens Test that rejuvenated Indian cricket. The half decade that followed was a golden one with the bat, as tours of England and Australia realised more than 600 runs."", ""A two-year stint as captain, following Ganguly's axing, was less successful, though he did lead the side to series victories in England and the West Indies for the first time in a generation. Just when it seemed his best was behind him, Dravid showed his class once again on the tour to England in 2011. In a series in which India were completely outplayed and none of their other batsmen scored more than 275 runs in the Tests, Dravid amassed 461, including three hundreds, two of them when opening the innings against a high-quality pace attack. However, that was followed by a poor series in Australia, which turned out to be his last, as he announced his retirement soon after returning to India."", ""Dravid's immense levels of concentration also came in handy when he was standing in the slips. Most of his catches were taken in that cordon as he overtook Mark Waugh to become the most successful slip catcher in history.\n""]","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2000', 'ICC Test Player of the Year 2004', 'ICC Player of the Year 2004']",164.0,286,32,13288,270,52.31,31258,42.51,36,63,1654,21,210.0,0.0,344.0,318,40,10889,153,39.16,15284,71.24,12,83,950,42,196.0,14.0,1.0,1,0,31,31,31,21,147.61,0,0,0,3,0.0,0.0,298.0,497,67,23794,270,55.33,,,68,117,,,353.0,1.0,449.0,416,55,15271,153,42.3,,,21,112,,,233.0,17.0,109.0,101,7,2586,75*,27.51,2271,113.87,0,13,311,34,23,0,164.0,5,120,39,1,Jan-18,Jan-18,39,1.95,120,0,0,0,344.0,8,186,170,4,Feb-43,Feb-43,42.5,5.48,46.5,0,0,0,1.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,298.0,,617,273,5,Feb-16,,54.6,2.65,123.4,,0,0,449.0,,477,421,4,Feb-43,Feb-43,105.25,5.29,119.2,0,0,0,109.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

He made his first-class debut for Bengal in 2005, and impressed many with his consistent pace, generated from an exaggerated leap into his delivery stride. \n', ""Despite being a late addition to the Kolkata Knight Riders' squad for the inaugural IPL season in 2008, Dinda took nine wickets in 13 games at an economy rate of 6.66.

He has done so coming from the cricketing backwaters, the mining state of Jharkhand, and through a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scales the highs and lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007."", ' \n', 'Dhoni, then a ticket inspector with the Indian Railways, had escaped all attention bar the odd whisper among the followers of club cricket in Kolkata until he was 23 when he blasted two centuries in a triangular 50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi in 2004. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI innings of 148 and 183 within a year of his debut.', ""Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected. He improvised, he learned, but didn't make an apology about his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He still batted with low, hockey hands, he still didn't look elegant but became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes."", ""Along the way Dhoni showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007. Just before that announcement from Dravid, Dhoni had taken a bunch of kids to South Africa and was leading India to a World Cup win in a format the country didn't even take seriously. The ODI captaincy was natural progression, and Anil Kumble just kept the seat warm in Tests for a year."", ""Dhoni brought to captaincy a thick skin and relative indifference to results that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with coach Gary Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they returned the favour with some of their best years in international cricket. His calmness on the field helped and worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although tactically he sometimes sat back for too long in Tests. All that can't argue against the fact that India had some of their best years in Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under Dhoni, and that Dhoni has for years been among the best few ODI batsmen in the world."", ""However, post the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 and his patented helicopter shot, reality struck, and an ageing team kept losing in unfamiliar conditions. After eight straight Test losses away from home, Dhoni the captain came under immense pressure, which was accentuated by a 2-1 home series loss to England in 2012-13, the first time India had lost at home in more than eight years. This brought out a new chapter in Dhoni's career wherein he seemed more assertive as a captain, started building a new team, played his best Test innings on a turner to win India the Chennai Test against Australia, and became the first captain to lead India to win four wins in a series. "", '  ', ""Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came close to wins on both tours. The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests, dealing with the seam movement and bounce by stepping down the pitch and taking blows on his body.\n \nWins once again proved elusive on the tour of Australia that followed, though India competed ferociously thanks to a young batting core led by Virat Kohli. "", 'Kohli had captained the side in the first Test, with Dhoni injured, and he would lead them in the fourth and final Test too, with Dhoni making a surprise announcement after the third Test in Melbourne that he was retiring from the longest format.\n \nThough his game was not as suited to Tests as it was to limited-overs cricket, Dhoni ended his career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper, with 4876 runs at an average of just over 38, and six hundreds. He had also captained India to more Test wins - 27 - than anyone else. ', 'Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they shrugged off a win-less tour of Australia by reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 World Cup. A year later, they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited the World T20 in the semi-finals, at home. Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings; he showed electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners and indicated he could yet play on till the 2019 World Cup, though he gave up the limited-overs captaincy in January 2017. ', ' ', 'Dhoni has also found a new home in the IPL, having been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise for the first eight seasons of the tournament, leading them to two titles and four runner-up finishes. He became so deeply associated with the city that he even became a co-owner of a Chennai-based football franchise.

That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. \n"", ' \nDhawan is one in a long line of stroke-players from Delhi, which became the Indian batting capital in the 2000s.

His average stayed steady in the mid-40s, but he didn't quite dare the selectors to overlook him. After lukewarm showing in the IPL and five ODIs, and with the Test openers going well, it seemed Dhawan would be left consigned to domestic cricket and T20 leagues."", "" \nFortune turned, though, and both Sehwag and Gambhir lost form dramatically, giving Dhawan a chance at the age of 27 with 81 caps and 5679 first-class runs to his name already. Dhawan grabbed the chance with arguably the best debut by an Indian batsman, smashing 187 off 174 balls to set up India's win in a Test that was reduced to four days.

He opened well in all three forms of the game. He could be more aggressive than Virender Sehwag, played the kind of back-to-the-wall innings that would do Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman proud, and accumulated without taking any risks, much like Sachin Tendulkar has been doing in the last quarter of his career. Either side of that period, though, livid disappointment with his technical flaws dominating his other attributes. Still, with over 10000 runs from his 56 Tests, 147 ODIs and 37 T20Is - not to mention leading Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles - Gambhir has been a grand contributor to Indian cricket.', ' \n', 'Gambhir almost did not make it, ""not wanting to play anymore"" when he was dropped for the 2007 World Cup. For about eight first years of his career, he was the domestic cheque that would not be honoured at international level. While the bowlers on the Ranji circuit swore by this little left-hand batsman, he had just two international centuries to show after 13 Tests and 19 ODIs when he was left out of the World Cup party.', 'He came back with massive runs in domestic cricket, a few important technical adjustments, and with the reputation of being the best player of spin in India, outside the international side. A century in his second ODI back and a final-winning fifty in the inaugural World Twenty20 paved the way for his Test return. Test fifties against Murali and Mendis in the summer of Murali and Mendis in 2008 told him he belonged. In his next 13 Tests, he scored eight centuries: centuries to set up wins, centuries to bat opposition out, and centuries to hold on for draws, including the near 11-hour marathon in Napier. The Arjuna Award came his way, the ICC named him the Test player of 2009, but much more tellingly Sehwag called him the best Indian Test opener since Sunil Gavaskar. He scored a match-winning 97 in the 2011 World Cup final.\n', ""After the World Cup, though, began a more serious, almost terminal decline. As the Indian Test side went from sublime to ridiculous, Gambhir's failures went unpunished. In England and Australia, where India lost eight continuous Tests, Gambhir was a walking wicket, poking at deliveries outside off. From being a captaincy candidate at one time, he went to struggling to keep his place in the side. "", ' ', 'With the arrivals of M Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan, Gambhir was sidelined until an England tour in 2014 when he was called-up as back-up opener. But his return after more than a year out of international cricket ended on a sour note when he was dropped after four innings. Gambhir was on far firmer ground in the IPL - having been a mainstay at Delhi Daredevils and then going to Knight Riders for a record US $2.4 million in the 2011 auction. Gambhir went into the 2016 IPL with 39 fifty-plus scores - the second-most by an Indian in all T20 cricket.

Bowling with a windmilling, whiplash action, remodelled after he was reported for throwing, he deals by varying his length and his pace, and can turn it the other way too. His deadliest ball, however, is the one that climbs wickedly from a length, forcing a hurried jab.

When he channels his natural combativeness in the right direction, he can be a fiercely competitive and dangerous opponent. He was expected to be India's lead spinner in the all three forms of the game after Anil Kumble's retirement, but following a run of poor form was dropped from India's Test team for home series against West Indies and the tour of Australia in the 2011-12 season. \n"", 'Harbhajan eventually made a comeback to the Test side, and became the 10th Indian to have played 100 Tests when he took field against Australia in Chennai.', 'However, he was dropped after the next Test and was banished to the domestic set-up.

No word describes Virat Kohli better. His passion for cricket has made him one of the best batsmen in the world across formats, and has also helped him grow into a ruthless captain. It's also passion that defines Kohli's emotional, effervescent and at times firecracker character. Virat Kohli does not hold back and that remains his strength. \n"", 'Kohli approaches 30 as the most relentless and popular performer in the sport. He is already a World Cup winner (2011), the Player of the tournament at a World T20 (2014) and has led India to a record eight consecutive Test series wins. Purely as a batsman he is already close to the summit: by his 29th birthday he had more ODI hundreds (32) than anyone apart from Sachin Tendulkar (49), and averages 49 or better in all three formats. He is the only batsman to have achieved this feat.', ""He is widely considered to be one of the four great batsmen of his era, the others being Australia's Steven Smith, England's Joe Root and New Zealand's Kane Williamson."", ""In 2012, four years after his India debut, Kohli forced the cricket world's attention upon himself. In the fourth and final Test of a dismal Australia tour for India, who were already 3-0 down, Kohli came to the fore with a composed 116 in Adelaide. It was his maiden Test hundred, and the only century by an Indian batsman on that tour. Later, in the ODI triangular that followed, he uncorked an astonishing, unbeaten 86-ball 133 to help India chase down 321 in 36.4 overs against Sri Lanka. Soon after, he made an ODI career-best 183 against Pakistan in a chase of 331."", ""There is no better batsman than Kohli in chases: he says targets allow him to think clearly and pace his innings. He is unique in that he allies this clarity of thought with a classical batting technique and a supremely confident mindset. A stable head, sure footwork and firm wrists are part of Kohli's arsenal, which helps him play an array of audacious shots."", ""Fluent all around the ground, Kohli is equally confident off the front and back foot. And he isn't shy to move away from tradition and take guard a yard outside his crease, as he did on the tour of Australia in 2014-15. Having been embarrassed by James Anderson in England, he made this technical adjustment on the advice of India coach Ravi Shastri, and scored four centuries including twin hundreds in Adelaide. He finished the series as the second-highest run-getter behind Smith, as Australia won 2-0."", 'Since then, and in no small measure helped by playing Tests at home, India have won series against South Africa, England, Australia and New Zealand while winning away in the West Indies and twice in Sri Lanka.', 'The biggest turning point - and probably the most pivotal moment - of Kohli\'s career arrived on December 30, 2014, when MS Dhoni announced his unexpected retirement from Tests following the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Kohli could not believe that Dhoni would no longer wear whites, and that he would now lead India. The second thought made him cry. ""If you told me when I started playing cricket that at 26 I will be Test captain of India... no chance,"" is how he later described his feelings.', '""A brat, arrogant and casual"" was how Kohli described himself in 2008, when he then became the second India captain to lift the Under-19 World Cup. He excelled in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore, which put him on the world map and made sponsors line up at his doorstep, making him a brand even before he had established himself in international cricket. But as he steadily grew to become India\'s most dependable batsman, and not just a brand, Kohli realised he needed to rid of old, bad habits. He lost weight, gained focus and became a relentless force, supremely fit and quick across the turf, and perhaps the hungriest batsman in the world when it comes to converting ones into twos.', 'The IPL helped Kohli, like many other Indians, play positively. He is certain that his 52-ball 100* in a chase of 360 against Australia in the Jaipur ODI of 2013 (still the fastest by an Indian) was only possible because of his post-IPL mindset. In 2016, Kohli smacked four centuries in the tournament, having not scored even a single ton in his first eight seasons. When Royal Challengers finished as runners-up in 2016, Kohli was just 27 runs short of reaching an unprecedented 1000 runs for the season.', 'Kohli has played with men who presented him awards when he was a chubby-faced schoolboy, and some of the same men have ended up playing under his captaincy. Under Kohli, India have ascended to the No. 1 Test ranking and held onto it with an iron grip while also reaching the joint top position in ODIs. He has set his sights quite a bit higher, though: his quest is to create a legacy like the ones established by all-conquering captains like Clive Lloyd and Steve Waugh.\n']",['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year 2012'],77.0,131,8,6613,243,53.76,11549,57.26,25,20,731,19,72.0,0.0,227.0,219,37,10843,183,59.57,11664,92.96,41,49,1019,116,111.0,0.0,67.0,62,17,2263,90*,50.28,1647,137.4,0,20,223,54,33.0,0.0,109.0,179,15,8862,243,54.03,15452,57.35,32,28,1044,34,103.0,0.0,261.0,252,40,12285,183,57.94,13200,93.06,45,57,1183,140,129.0,0.0,253.0,239,46,7911,113,40.98,5924,133.54,4,58,727,251,115,0,77.0,9,163,76,0,-,-,-,2.79,-,0,0,0,227.0,48,641,665,4,Jan-15,Jan-15,166.25,6.22,160.2,0,0,0,67.0,12,146,198,4,Jan-13,Jan-13,49.5,8.13,36.5,0,0,0,109.0,23,631,330,3,Jan-19,Feb-42,110,3.13,210.3,0,0,0,261.0,55,705,726,4,Jan-15,Jan-15,181.5,6.17,176.2,0,0,0,253.0,44,454,661,8,Feb-25,Feb-25,82.62,8.73,56.7,0,0,0

He swings the new ball and reverses the old, he does well on flat subcontinent pitches and relishes the helpful ones away, and he controls all three balls well - SG, Duke and Kookaburra. He might not quite have the skills of Wasim Akram, who he has often been compared to, but mentally Zaheer has become as good as Akram. He knows how to get wickets, he has an intuitive sense of when to go for the kill, and once a batsman has shown him the slightest hint of a weakness, Zaheer preys on it ruthlessly. Unlike the Pakistan fast bowlers of the 2000s, though, he stays away from controversy and is pretty low-key off the field.\n\xa0 \n', ""Zaheer's career can be easily divided into three distinct sections, neatly segregated by injuries. He was all promise ever since he bowled Steve Waugh with a full delivery in the Champions Trophy in 2000. A mysterious injury in Australia in 2003-04 - hamstring at first and later discovered to be a nerve twitch - then tortured him for the best part of the next two years. Every comeback ended in a frustrating setback through a new injury."", '\xa0\nIn 2006, though, Zaheer, now with a shorter run up, a fitter body and a meaner mind, dazzled England with 78 wickets for Worcestershire, where team-mates started calling him \'Zippy Zakky\'. He was the perfect foil for Sreesanth in South Africa, and he then regained his status as leader of the pack with a match-winning display at Trent Bridge, as India won only their fifth Test on English soil. The new, lethal Zaheer was not only the leader of the Indian attack, he was one of the best in the world. With his guidance, India claimed the No. 1 ranking in Tests and the World Cup in 2011, which he called ""my greatest cricketing moment.""', ""\nZaheer was seen as a vital resource ahead of a lengthy Test season comprising a four-Test tour of England and then a four-Test tour of Australia in 2011-12. But a hamstring injury on the very first day led to India losing one of their premier match-winners, and also every one of those matches. It wasn't until Zaheer's return for the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that India could stem their run of Test losses overseas. At 35 years, he still had all the tricks but his pace was down and he looked rather spent even while playing the second of back-to-back Tests in Durban.\n\xa0"", 'There was no doubting how much Zaheer prized Test cricket though. He took a five-for in what became his final Test - the same one in which Brendon McCullum hit a triple ton - and ended his career with 311 Test wickets, second only to Kapil Dev among Indian fast bowlers.', '\xa0\nZaheer continues to do his bit in the IPL though.

A fellow Gujarati, Mahatma Gandhi, could well have meant to say this about Ravindra Jadeja. The best of observers ignored his steady left-arm spin at first, then he was ridiculed for his three triple-centuries in Ranji Trophy, the idea of Jadeja the Test player was contested when India gave him debut in 2012-13 against conventional wisdom, but in India\'s series win against Australia, Jadeja won them all over, not least by dismissing Michael Clarke five times in six innings. \n', ""\nThe ridicule of Jadeja's triples - more than any Indian has ever hit in first-class cricket - was actually an indictment of Indian domestic cricket, that a batsman proven to be limited in his days in international cricket could score triples with ease because of the quality of tracks and attacks. However, his record with the ball in ODIs, his fielding, and his rocket arm made him a valuable player in shorter formats, which showed when Chennai Super Kings paid $2 million to secure his services. In August 2013 he topped the ICC's ODI bowling rankings, becoming the first Indian to do so since Anil Kumble in 1996."", '\nShane Warne, his IPL captain at Rajasthan Royals, nicknamed Jadeja ""rockstar"" because of his confidence in his own ability, but his utility lies in his ability to do the dirty work. He is unerring in his accuracy, can bowl overs and overs without tiring, and maximises the natural variation available in the pitch. His fielding and his batting made him an easy pick as a third spinner in Tests in India, a ploy that worked like a charm in India\'s 4-0 win against Australia in early 2013. Clarke, one of the better players of spin going around, will testify, as will 24 wickets at 17.45 in what was his first full series.\xa0', ""\nWhen R Ashwin suffered a dip in form, Jadeja became India's lead spinner on the tours of South Africa and New Zealand in 2013-14 and the first part of their England tour of 2014. While he had his moments, such as a six-for in Durban and a breezy, match-turning 57-ball 68 at Lord's, his bowling was one-dimensional and rarely penetrative on most of the surfaces India encountered. He sat out the fifth Test of the England tour, and flew home early from the Australia tour of 2014-15 with a shoulder injury."", ""\nJadeja's bowling lacked both the accuracy and the bite of old when he returned for the 2015 World Cup, suggesting that his shoulder had still to recover fully.

In his first three matches of the 2015-16 Ranji Trophy season, all in Rajkot, on dustbowls prepared to maximise the threat of his bowling, he picked up six successive five-wicket hauls - apart from scoring two half-centuries - for Saurashtra.

Recalled to the one-day side during the 2001-2002 home season, he made an impact with some steady and purposeful batting. But it was during the 2002 NatWest series in England that he truly hit the high notes, culminating in a magnificent unbeaten 87 as India successfully chased 326 for victory in the final. A superb century followed - against Zimbabwe in the ICC Champions Trophy - but he struggled at times to kick on after that, having a fairly quiet World Cup. His first experience of the county circuit was also a mixed bag, some typically dynamic efforts interspersed by a string of low scores. Kaif's exceptional fielding at cover often overshadowed his poor scores with the bat - including a horror run in 2005-06 - but even that hasn't been enough to win him a permanent place in the Test side. He was dropped for more than a year before being recalled to the Test squad for the second Test against South Africa in Ahmedabad -  backed by an impressive domestic season - as a replacement for the injured Sachin Tendulkar. He was also the most expensive player in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team.  \n"", ' March 2008 \n']",[],13.0,22,3,624,148*,32.84,1548,40.31,1,3,64,2,14.0,0.0,125.0,110,24,2753,111*,32.01,3822,72.03,2,17,228,9,55.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,186.0,289,24,10229,202*,38.6,,,19,59,,,170.0,0.0,269.0,248,42,7763,151*,37.68,,,6,59,,,125.0,0.0,75.0,68,11,1237,70,21.7,1201,102.99,0,7,117,26,42,0,13.0,1,18,4,0,-,-,-,1.33,-,0,0,0,125.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,186.0,,1484,715,20,03-Apr,,35.75,2.89,74.2,,0,0,269.0,,1166,1009,33,Apr-23,Apr-23,30.57,5.19,35.3,2,0,0,75.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

However, with two giant spinners - Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh - at the peak of their powers, there wasn't a place available for him in India's squad. \n"", ""Mishra made his international debut in 2003 during an ODI triangular in Bangladesh, but he had to wait until 2008 to get his first go in Tests. That opportunity came after an injury forced Kumble out of the Mohali Test against Australia. Mishra had a dream start to his Test career, becoming the sixth Indian to take a five-wicket haul on debut, foxing the Australians with his variations and finishing the series with 14 wickets from three Tests. With his debut series coinciding with Kumble's last, it was the opening he needed to establish himself as India's first-choice legspinner. But, his inability to extract turn on benign pitches and the lack of accuracy were his failings as other spinners overtook him in the pecking order. "", ""Mishra's struggles in international cricket aside, he has remained a vital cog for the Haryana Ranji side over the years, collecting a bagful of wickets. But, it's his performances in the IPL, where he has been one of the best spinners, and the only bowler to pick up three hat-tricks, that keep him in the limelight. The hat-tricks came for three different teams - Delhi Daredevils (2008), Deccan Chargers (2011) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2013). In 2015, Mishra returned to the team he first played for, with Daredevils paying INR 3.5 crore to secure his services."", ""A strong display in the 2013 IPL, during which he kept the batsmen guessing with his variations in flight and pace, earned him a call-up for India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy in England and the tour to Zimbabwe, almost two years after his last international appearance. He didn't disappoint, picking up 18 wickets at 11.61 in five ODIs against Zimbabwe, and equaling Javagal Srinath's record for the most wickets in a bilateral series. Mishra's good form continued into the World T20 the following year in Bangladesh, where he picked up 10 wickets at 14.70, while only conceding 6.68 runs per over, as India adopted a three-spinner strategy and finished runners-up to Sri Lanka."", ""With younger options thin on the ground, India recalled Mishra to the Test side for their 2015 tour of Sri Lanka.

Wristy, willowy and sinuous, he can match - sometimes even better - Tendulkar for strokeplay. His on-side game is comparable to his idol Azharuddin's, yet he is decidedly more assured on the off side and has the rare gift of being able to hit the same ball to either side. The Australians, who have suffered more than most, paid the highest compliment after India's 2003-04 tour Down Under by admitting they did not know where to bowl to him. Laxman, a one-time medical student, finally showed signs of coming to terms with his considerable gifts in March 2001, as he tormented Steve Waugh's thought-to-be-invincible Australians with a majestic 281 to stand the Kolkata Test on its head. But even though he had another wonderful series against the Australians in 2003-04 with two centuries, one of them involving a back-from-the-dead, match-winning, 300-plus partnership with Kolkata ally Rahul Dravid at Adelaide, he hasn't quite managed the consistency that could have turned him into a batting great.  Between dazzling and sometimes workmanlike hundreds, he has suffered the frustration of numerous twenties and thirties and has lost his place in the one-day side. Nothing, though, has deterred him from tormenting his favourite opponents with silken strokes and piles of runs: in the course of the double-hundred at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008, he became the second Indian batsman after Tendulkar to score more than 2000 runs against the Australians. A couple of years later, batting with a runner due to back spasms, he conjured up a magical unbeaten 73 in a thrilling run-chase in Mohali. \n"", 'However, in 2011 the runs dried up in two successive overseas trips - in eight innings in England he scored 182, and then the poor run continued in his favourite country and against his favourite opponent, Australia. With India losing those matches badly, his future as an international player was suddenly under threat.\n', ""There were calls from former players and commentators questioning Laxman's selection for the two-Test home series against New Zealand in August 2012.

But with all those gifts came a curse - his brittle body, which may well have contributed to him playing his last Test in 2004. Still T20 cricket, which has a cap of only four overs, gave Nehra a lifeline and at 36 he revived his international career because he had reprised the ability to move the ball at 140 kph, and became one of India\'s most successful bowlers in the 2016 World T20.\n \nNehra came out of his first full tour - to Zimbabwe in 2000-01 - with his reputation as one of the most promising new-ball bowlers on the international circuit vastly enhanced, and his performance in Bulawayo played a key role in India winning a Test outside the subcontinent for the first time in 15 years. He struggled to establish himself thereafter, as inconsistency and injuries saw him slip down the pace bowling list.\n \nThe high point of that difficult period came in the 2003 World Cup against England, where he scalped 6 for 23 and then threw up by the side of the pitch. Surgery on a troublesome ankle, and an indifferent tour of Australia followed, and Nehra\'s status as an automatic pick was lost. He pulled out midway through the 2005 Zimbabwe tour and had a succession of operations on his ankle that slowed down his career. He hit the headlines with creditable showings in the IPL, particularly in the second season, and was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 and found his mojo again.\n \nHis 31 ODI wickets in 2009 were the most he had ever taken in a year, and he followed it up with 28 dismissals in 2010 to establish his place in India\'s 2011 World Cup squad. He bowled a match-winning spell against Pakistan in the semi-final, but his body failed him again - an on-field injury prevented him from playing the final, which India won to become world champions.\n \nIt was long thought that was the end of Nehra, but he willed himself back into contention picking up 22 wickets for Chennai Super Kings in 2015 - the most by an Indian fast bowler.

The year was one of several highlights, including a haul of eight wickets against South Africa in Johannesburg, which helped India win their first Test in the country.', 'However, things turned sour two years later in the inaugural IPL, when he was involved in a spat with Harbhajan Singh, who slapped him at the end of a match. Sreesanth signed with Warwickshire and enjoyed a satisfactory first season, but injuries and a steady decline in form kept him out of the national team. His problems with discipline are well documented; he was warned by the BCCI with suspension from domestic cricket if he violated the code of conduct. But his ability with the ball continued to keep him in contention for a place in the Indian team in Tests and ODIs.', ""The biggest shock in his volatile career came when he was among three Rajasthan Royals players arrested in May 2013, along with Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan, for the alleged fulfilling of promises made to bookmakers in the IPL.

However, for a player of his class, the first six years of his international career were frustrating for him, the team, and the spectators, as the odd delightful innings was followed and preceded by plenty of failures. It all came together finally in 2013, when Rohit was promoted to open the innings in ODIs. The move turned out to be a masterstroke, as Rohit found form in the Champions Trophy, and then went into overdrive in the ODI series against Australia, scoring two centuries, including 209, only the third double in ODI cricket. That led to a place in the Test team, and Rohit responded by scoring centuries in his first two Test innings, becoming the fifth batsman to do so. A year later, he became the first batsman to hit two ODI double-hundreds, in an innings where he smashed the record for the highest score with 264 off 173 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens.    \n', ""For the first six years of his career, though, Rohit struggled to come up with the sort of numbers which would justify his talent. He first came to limelight when he exuded class at No. 3 in the Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006. He took that class with him when he played for India in their triumphant World Twenty20 campaign in 2007 and the CB Series in Australia in early 2008, scoring two fifties, including a vital 66 in the first final in Sydney. However that ability to look good at the crease didn't translate into long innings in his first two first-class seasons for Mumbai. He kept making strides in the big league, though. He was bought for US$750,000 by the Deccan Chargers in the IPL, and made 404 runs at 36.73 including four fifties. "", ""He pressed a claim for higher things through two centuries in the 2008-09 Ranji final, a feat last achieved by Sachin Tendulkar and only four others before him. However, his lack of consistency meant he wasn't a part of India's World Cup-winning squad, and returned to national duty only when the top players were rested on the tour to the West Indies in 2011. There, he made his presence felt with consistent scores in the ODIs and the Man-of-the-Series award. But his form continued to fluctuate in the months that followed, and he remained one of India's most promising but unfulfilled talents over the next couple of years. All that changed in 2013, and with Tendulkar retiring from Tests and ODIs that year, Rohit looked set to be a permanent fixture in the Indian team across formats."", ""Then came the 2015 World Cup and Rohit ended up as India's second-highest run-scorer, with an impressive 137 against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, further cementing his place in the top order. He added another feather to his captaincy hat when he led Mumbai Indians to their second IPL title in 2015.

Standing at 6\'4"", his rhythmic, high-arm action allowed him to bowl at around 140 kph. For one who started serious cricket at 14, his rise was rapid and he made his Ranji Trophy debut at 18. An injury to Munaf Patel provided him an opening during India\'s tour of Bangladesh in May 2007 but it was in Australia where he caught the attention, prompting Steve Waugh to call him the next best thing in Indian cricket. He showed he could move the ball both ways and his probing spell in the second innings in Perth, where he set-up Ricky Ponting, is the stuff of folklore. He continued to impress in the one-day series, clocking more than 150kph once, and ended as India\'s highest wicket-taker in the triumphant campaign.  \n', ""The glory days continued through his debut season, with a notable performance against South Africa, followed by 15 wickets in four Tests in the succesful home series against Australia in 2008, and a couple of strong shows in Sri Lanka in ODIs. By now Ishant was clearly Zaheer Khan's deputy in the Indian seam arsenal, but things have gone seriously wrong since. Some have blamed it on his being over-bowled, particularly on flat tracks in the IPL, while others point to a malaise that has afflicted all of India's new crop of fast bowlers. The fact remains that Ishant lost the most crucial aspect of his bowling - his pace. Without it, his natural short-of-a-good-length that had tormented batsmen of Ponting's calibre a season earlier lost its venom. Eventually the loss of pace led to a loss of self-confidence. The Indian selectors decided to be careful and began shielding him from the shorter formats of the game in 2009 in the hope that he would rediscover his zip. His struggle continued but given India's limited seam-bowling resources at the time, Ishant was persisted with, even after an ankle surgery in 2012 that put him out of action for months. When he completed 50 Tests in early 2013 he had among the worst averages for bowlers with 50 Test caps to their name."", ""Since then Ishant has somewhat revived his Test career. He was impressive on the tour of New Zealand, being the top wicket-taker in Tests with 15 wickets that included two five-wicket hauls. On his next overseas assignment, in England, Ishant was the hero of India's famous win at Lord's when he bounced out the England batsmen with his spell of 7 for 74, helping India to a 1-0 lead in the Test series. It was perhaps one of his best performances for India in whites.  "", 'He soon suffered a leg injury and was ruled out for the following two Tests. He did return for the fifth Test but his 4 for 96 was only part of an embarrassing innings defeat for India. He then went back to Australia, the country that had kick-started his career, but he could only manage mediocre performances in the three Tests he was a part of. His landing foot was proving to be a constant irritant to his fitness and the fast bowler picked up another injury, this time to his knee and was ruled out of the ODI tri-series that followed. Ishant failed to recover in time for the World Cup and was replaced by Mohit Sharma.']",[],90.0,124,43,627,31*,7.74,2211,28.35,0,0,71,0,19.0,0.0,80.0,28,13,72,13,4.8,203,35.46,0,0,6,0,19.0,0.0,14.0,3,2,8,5*,8,9,88.88,0,0,1,0,4.0,0.0,132.0,168,62,889,66,8.38,2954,30.09,0,1,100,3,29.0,0.0,123.0,45,20,174,31,6.96,368,47.28,0,0,12,1,26.0,0.0,120.0,30,22,55,9,6.87,75,73.33,0,0,4,1,28.0,0.0,90.0,161,17196,9155,267,Jul-74,10/108,34.28,3.19,64.4,9,8,1,80.0,78,3733,3563,115,Apr-34,Apr-34,30.98,5.72,32.4,6,0,0,14.0,14,278,400,8,Feb-34,Feb-34,50,8.63,34.7,0,0,0,132.0,234,24571,12557,426,Jul-24,Nov-51,29.47,3.06,57.6,18,13,2,123.0,120,5834,5154,178,May-21,May-21,28.95,5.3,32.7,10,1,0,120.0,120,2575,3356,93,05-Dec,05-Dec,36.08,7.81,27.6,1,1,0

His impressive showings meant he quickly climbed the rungs to the Baroda U-19 and the West Zone U-19 sides. He made his debut in the Ranji Trophy against Saurashtra in 2001-02, but it wasn't until the 2004-05 season, by when younger brother Irfan Pathan was donning national colours, that he established himself as a regular in the Baroda squad. Yusuf ended the 2004-05 season as Baroda's fourth-highest scorer and third-highest wicket-taker.  \n"", ""His ability to score runs quickly - he had the highest strike rate in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy (min 200 runs) - coupled with impressive performances in the one-day Deodhar Trophy and Twenty20 domestic tournament in the 2006-07 season was rewarded with a spot in India's squad for the inaugural World T20, in South Africa. "", ""Yusuf's impressive showing for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League in 2008 - 435 runs with four fifties at a strike-rate of 179 - earned him an ODI call-up for the tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in Pakistan. He recorded the fastest fifty of the IPL's first season - off 21 balls against Deccan Chargers - and his dazzling all-round show in the final was instrumental in Royals' triumph. But then a run of patchy scores in India's limited-overs squads had Yusuf dropped, but he replied with emphatically with a 190-ball, unbeaten, double century as West Zone sealed the highest first-class chase ever in the 2010 Duleep Trophy final. "", 'His ODI career hit a peak when he helped India chase 316 with a blistering century against New Zealand in December 2010.

His other aggressive performances on the domestic circuit - a century in the 2012-13 Vijay Hazare Trophy, fifites in the Deodhar Trophy, some all-round displays in the Ranji Trophy, and a 15-ball fifty in IPL 2014 have been sporadic, not allowing him a place in a talented Indian limited-overs middle order.

Within a couple of years in international cricket, he was thought of as a possible successor to Kapil in the all-round department. There was talent to back the hype: cast your mind back to January 2006, when the lethal curve of his late swing consumed, off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the Karachi Test, Salman Butt, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf; or to the previous Test in Faisalabad, where his 210-run partnership with MS Dhoni steered India past the follow-on mark. \n', ' \nBut a number of factors, not least the constant injuries that Kapil miraculously avoided, meant Irfan never really fulfilled his potential, and by his late 20s was more or less confined to bits-and-pieces roles in various IPL teams.', "" \nIrfan was 19 when he made his Test debut in Australia, but already looked the part, bowling at a brisk pace and troubling quality batsmen with his left-arm swing. He played a big part in India's one-day and Test series wins on their revival tour of Pakistan in 2004."", ' \nHis batting soon took off and, under the management team of Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, he was regularly pushed up the order in ODIs - with a promotion to No.3 immediately yielding a spectacular 83 against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. He was more than just a clean ball-striker, though, and his sensible, straight-bat approach often bailed India out of strife in Tests as well.', "" \nBut, either side of that Karachi hat-trick, his bowling form nosedived, with his pace dropping significantly, and he struggled to make both the Test and ODI teams by the time 2006 had ended. He was sent back from the tour of South Africa in 2006 to focus on domestic cricket. He made the 2007 World Cup squad but didn't figure in a single game during India's disappointing campaign, and was thereafter dropped from both the Test and ODI sides."", ' \nRecalled for the inaugural World T20 in September 2007, Pathan did not disappoint, snapping up 10 wickets at 14.90. His crucial spell of 3 for 16 in the final against Pakistan earned him the Man-of-the-Match award.', "" \nIrfan returned to the ODI side for the home series against Australia and Pakistan, and showed he had rediscovered his rhythm, based on which he was handed a recall in the third Test against Pakistan in Bangalore. He celebrated his comeback by making his first Test hundred. He was subsequently picked for the Test series in Australia, and came into the side for the third Test in Perth, where he played a crucial part in India's famous win - with five wickets and scores of 28 and 46 to claim the Man-of-the-Match award."", "" \nIrfan lost his place in the India squad in 2009 and subsequently struggled with loss of form and injuries. A back injury forced him to spend eight months on the sidelines after the 2010 IPL, and he missed the entire domestic season. That did not stop him from being bought for $1.9 million by Delhi Daredevils at the 2011 IPL auction in January. After a mixed IPL season, he impressed during the 2011-12 Ranji Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker after four rounds of the tournament. His performances earned him a recall to the national side when he was picked for the final two ODIs against the West Indies in December, 2011. He came into his own during the one-day series in Sri Lanka in 2012, finishing as the highest wicket-taker and most economical bowler. He played the 2012 World T20 - also in Sri Lanka - and played all of India's games in the tournament, before injury struck once more."", ' \nIrfan has played no international cricket since then, but remains, like his brother Yusuf, a sought-after name at the IPL. He has had stints at Kings XI Punjab, Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad, as well as an injury-ravaged 2015 season where he did not play a single game for Chennai Super Kings.

Initially, Parthiv's glovework varied from competent to shoddy, but it was his ability with the bat that got him an extended run with the national side. But, his increasingly sloppy work behind the stumps saw him lose his place in 2004, and with the emergence of Dinesh Karthik and then MS Dhoni, Parthiv went further down in the pecking order. \n"", ""Parthiv made sporadic comebacks but with Dhoni firmly entrenched in the limited-overs sides, he had to compete for the second keeper's slot with Wriddhiman Saha - who became the first-choice wicket-keeper in Tests following Dhoni's retirement - Naman Ojha and Karthik.

Kiran More had seen him bowl in the nets and sent him straight to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai to train under TA Sekhar and Dennis Lillee. Soon he was being hailed as the fastest man in Indian cricket. Then, even as Baroda and Gujarat vied for his services, Munaf chose Mumbai, after Sachin Tendulkar had taken special interest in him and had a word with the authorities in the Mumbai Cricket Association. Even then Munaf's first-class career was anything but smooth as he spent more time recovering from various injuries than actually playing. \n"", ""Strongly built though not overly tall, Munaf gradually gathers momentum in his approach to the crease, before releasing the ball with a windmill-whirl of the hands. His priority, in his early years, was to bowl quick. And it was this that first caught the eye of More and others. Later, he added reverse swing to his repertoire and troubled batsmen with a well-directed yorker. After plenty of speculation and close calls he finally received a call from the national selection panel for the second Test against England in March 2006, after an impressive performance for the Board President's XI saw him pick up 10 English wickets for 91 runs. In Mohali a week later, he ended with 7 for 97, the best performance by an Indian fast bowler on Test debut. A consistent series against West Indies later that year meant Munaf had established himself as a regular member of the side.

With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket. Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much more. \n"", 'As a starry-eyed youngster from Najafgarh, where his family ran a flour mill, Sehwag grew up, like many others from his generation, wanting to be Sachin Tendulkar. Indeed, when he scored his first one-day hundred, filling up for his injured idol against New Zealand in Sri Lanka, he could have been mistaken for him: there was the same back-foot punch on the off side, the minimalistic straight drive and the wristy whip to the leg. And on his Test debut, on a fiery pitch in Bloemfontein, he matched the master stroke for stroke as they both blazed away to hundreds. But soon he emerged his own man, and not long after Tendulkar was playing a supporting, and somewhat calming, hand as Sehwag romped away to a triple-hundred, the first by an Indian, in Multan, bringing it up with a six. Two Tests ago, he had been dismissed trying the same stroke five short of what would have been his first Test double-hundred.', ""His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as quickly as possible - belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his own, and his opponents', strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What appears risky to many, is merely an opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in trouble against the moving ball, is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork. Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side, and fewer still have hit them as frequently. And the sight of a spinner brings the savage out in him: and for many spectacular assaults against the world's leading spinners, there have numerous outrageous dismissals against the not-so-reputed ones."", ""The most remarkable aspect of Sehwag's career of course has been his ability to build massive scores at breathtaking speed. He holds the Indian record for highest number of Test double-hundreds, and came within seven runs of becoming the first batsman to score three triple-hundreds. That innings, against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, epitomised the Sehwag brand of batsmanship: a mix of imagination, daring, power, skills, and clarity of vision. His ODI career doesn't have as many high points, and yet he held the record for the highest score in that format at one point, scoring an astonishing 219 against West Indies in Indore. The most remarkable feature of the innings was the ease with which he reached the landmark, completing his double-hundred with more than six overs to spare.  "", 'Sehwag is equally refreshing off the field and shares his views on the game in an endearingly direct and candid manner, a rare trait among contemporary cricketers. He is, in every sense, a true original.']",['ICC Test Player of the Year 2010'],104.0,180,6,8586,319,49.34,10441,82.23,23,32,1233,91,91.0,0.0,251.0,245,9,8273,219,35.05,7929,104.33,15,38,1132,136,93.0,0.0,19.0,18,0,394,68,21.88,271,145.38,0,2,43,16,2.0,0.0,194.0,321,11,14683,319,47.36,,,42,55,,,166.0,0.0,332.0,321,14,10454,219,34.05,,,16,57,,,120.0,0.0,159.0,157,6,4061,122,26.89,2747,147.83,2,24,487,147,42.0,0.0,104.0,91,3731,1894,40,5/104,5/118,47.35,3.04,93.2,0,1,0,251.0,146,4392,3853,96,04-Jun,04-Jun,40.13,5.26,45.7,1,0,0,19.0,1,6,20,0,-,-,-,20,-,0,0,0,194.0,,8614,4470,105,5/104,,42.57,3.11,82,,1,0,332.0,,6009,5154,142,04-Jun,04-Jun,36.29,5.14,42.3,3,0,0,159.0,28,358,496,22,Mar-14,Mar-14,22.54,8.31,16.2,0,0,0

An attacking left-hander who goes for the big shots with impunity and clears the field with a swashbuckling flourish when at the top of his game, Raina is also equally capable of attracting applause as an electric fielder in the circle. All of this, though, is tempered with an iffy technique against the short ball, which has been mercilessly exposed in Test cricket. \n', ""It took him five years to cement his place as an India regular, moving from a limited-overs specialist who played 98 ODIs to one who became the 12th Indian to make a Test century on debut. Raina made his Test debut in Sri Lanka as a replacement for injured team-mate Yuvraj Singh, who, like Raina, was a left-hander, a dasher, and in the early 2000s, India's most athletic fielder.

The ability to split the field and discover gaps where fielders could not be placed earned him high praise when he first burst through to play for India in December 2006. The early years, however, weren't so prolific, which led to his omission from the 2007 World Cup. He forced his way back with a mountain of runs in domestic cricket, and from June 2008 was prolific in ODIs too, enhancing his stature as one of India's responsible gen-next batsmen. Also helping his cause were three supremely successful seasons for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and in the Champions League. He was one of the four players retained by the franchise for the 2011 season."", ""His tenacity at the worst of times is typical of someone who has spent his teenage years living away from home in the demanding world of the Uttar Pradesh sports hostel, where a lack of facilities or grooming produces cricketers who must match talent with determination. At the under-19 level, Raina was prodigious with his run-scoring and a string of double-hundreds took him to the Indian junior team and beyond it, to India colours.

His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation.

His greatness was established early: he was only 16 when he made his Test debut. He was hit on the mouth by Waqar Younis but continued to bat, in a blood-soaked shirt. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batsman to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.', ""He currently holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred till his 79th match.

In 2012, when just one month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which like Bradman's batting average, could be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, Tendulkar retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, on his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium against West Indies.

When that switch is flicked on, given certain conditions, he can be one of the more pleasing sights in present-day cricket; when it is not, he can scratch and struggle on the flattest of pitches. He prefers to play off the front foot, which can bring his downfall, but it also produces some sensational hits down the ground, including the trademark pick-up shot over wide long-on. \n', ' ', 'In his first few seasons of first-class cricket, Vijay became famous for converting starts into huge scores. One of those big scores came in a 462-run opening stand with Abhinav Mukund, which earned him a Test call-up in 2008-09 as replacement for Gautam Gambhir, who was serving a one-match ban for an on-field altercation. The Test opportunities remained limited, but the IPL provided him with another sphere of influence.', ' ', ""However, the IPL also coincided with the drying up of huge scores. He kept scoring big in crucial IPL matches, but it seemed to have taken patience out of his game.

The efforts against Australia took his tally of 150-plus scores to seven out of 13 first-class hundreds, and earned him an ODI recall for the 2013 Champions Trophy in England - though a poor run in the warm-up games meant he did not make the playing eleven in the tournament.', ""\nHe soon became India's first-choice opener during the Tests in Australia in 2014-15, emerging as India's second-highest run-scorer behind only Virat Kohli.

And if the pitch is in anyway helpful to seam - as it was in his first and only Test five-wicket haul at Karachi in 2004 or against India at the same venue in January 2006 - he can be a proper danger. Though Kamran Akmal's hundred overshadowed all in the Karachi win over India, Razzaq's performance was easily his most emphatic as an allrounder: he scored 45 and 90 as well as taking seven wickets in the match. A combination of injuries and poor form put his Test place into question and a knee injury days before the 2007 World Cup meant Pakistan missed his presence in a disastrous campaign. "", 'A lackluster comeback to international cricket against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi and mediocre performance in the practice matches saw Razzaq being omitted from the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and consequently announce his retirement from international cricket. He then went on to sign for Worcestershire towards the end of the county season as well as signing up with the Indian Cricket League, which ruled him out of Pakistan contention. He took back his decision to retire but committed himself to the ICL for two seasons, during which he served the Hyderabad Heroes as one of their star players. ', ""After a global amnesty and quitting the ICL, he was welcomed back to the Pakistan fold for the World Twenty20 in England and made an immediate impact as Pakistan won the tournament. His Test comeback also looked set to be complete after he was included in Pakistan's 15-man squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in June. Early in his career he promised to be Pakistan's most complete allrounder since Imran Khan, and though for a variety of reasons he hasn't translated that into achievement, his country wouldn't mind having just a very solid allrounder. \n"", ' June 2009']",[],46.0,77,9,1946,134,28.61,4741,41.04,3,7,230,23,15.0,0.0,265.0,228,57,5080,112,29.7,6252,81.25,3,23,382,124,35.0,0.0,32.0,29,10,393,46*,20.68,337,116.61,0,0,21,21,2.0,0.0,123.0,193,28,5371,203*,32.55,,,8,29,,,33.0,0.0,345.0,299,71,6851,112,30.04,,,3,38,,,51.0,0.0,142.0,126,31,2578,109,27.13,1967,131.06,1,9,222,107,19.0,0.0,46.0,76,7008,3694,100,May-35,7/155,36.94,3.16,70,4,1,0,265.0,254,10941,8564,269,Jun-35,Jun-35,31.83,4.69,40.6,8,3,0,32.0,22,339,395,20,Mar-13,Mar-13,19.75,6.99,16.9,0,0,0,123.0,,19206,11155,355,Jul-51,,31.42,3.48,54.1,,13,2,345.0,,14516,11689,385,Jun-35,Jun-35,30.36,4.83,37.7,13,4,0,142.0,128,2457,3133,135,Apr-13,Apr-13,23.2,7.65,18.2,2,0,0

When all is not well, he looks so awkward you forget he can hit the ball clean and long. All has been well with Yuvraj more often in limited-overs cricket, where he can be effortless and brutal at the same time, than in Tests, though his form and consistency has been on the decline since his comeback following a recovery from a rare form of germ cell cancer in 2012. When he started off, though, his athleticism on the field and his canny left-arm spin made him a key one-day player as Indian cricket went through a makeover at the turn of the century. \n', 'Yuvraj\'s father, Yograj, who played one Test for India, was what Mike Agassi was to Andre. So obsessed was he with Yuvraj\'s cricket that he took a skating gold medal off his young son\'s neck and threw it out of the car. ""From now on, you are going to play cricket."" And from then on he has played cricket. The major shift came when, at 15, he carried kitbags in crowded local trains, living away from his parents and a luxurious life in Punjab. At 18 he was shredding a strong Australian attack, in only his second ODI, in the Champions Trophy in 2000.', ""Soon Yuvraj would become India's middle-order lynchpin, forming fruitful partnerships first with Rahul Dravid and then with MS Dhoni. Both batsmen, superb ODI operators in their own right, credited their success to Yuvraj's ability to score at will. Testament to Yuvraj's importance is that when he was dropped from the ODI side in 2010, it was the first such occurrence since he cemented his place in the Indian team. His ODI career is full of highlight reels, with the biggest impact being his contribution to India's World Cup triumph in 2011 - 362 runs, 15 wickets, and four Man-of-the-Match awards, and the Player of the Tournament. That put to shade even his awesome achievement in the World T20 triumph in 2007, where he famously hit a Stuart Broad over for six sixes."", ""However, his limitations have manifested themselves in Tests, where he has struggled both against the seaming and swinging ball, and quality spin. Apart from three shining innings - a sparkling century on a Lahore greentop, another from 61 for 4 against Pakistan, and an unbeaten 85 in a successful chase of 387 in Chennai - his Test career doesn't have much to write home about."", ""The World Cup win in 2011 was the biggest moment of his cricket career, but soon after that came the biggest challenge of his life, when he was diagnosed cancer which required a two-and-a-half month treatment in the USA. He returned home after completing his chemotherapy in April 2012, fairly confident that he could resume his duties on the cricket field reasonably quickly and in August he was named in India's squad for the World T20 in Sri Lanka."", 'In January 2013, poor form and fitness led to his ouster from the team. But a visibly slimmer and fitter Yuvraj emerged from a training stint in France in October and hit an unbeaten 35-ball 77 in a T20I against Australia on his comeback. But lack of consistency meant he was out of the ODI mix after the tour of South Africa in December 2013.', ""Even as his form dipped, Yuvraj continued to be a hot pick at the IPL auction, picking up contracts worth over a million dollars in 2014 ($2.33 million or Rs 14 crore to RCB), 2015 ($2.67 million or Rs 16 crore to Delhi Daredevils) and 2016 ($1.04 million or Rs 7 crore to Sunrisers Hyderabad). The hype surrounding him didn't transcend onto the cricket field, however, and the low point was a laboured 21-ball 11 in the final of the 2014 World T20 which resulted in India losing momentum and eventually the title to Sri Lanka. "", ""In January 2016, he made yet another international return, in Australia, for the T20 stretch leading into the World T20, where a twisted ankle curtailed his tournament. He hadn't had a great time at the World T20, his 52 runs coming at an average of 13.00 and a strike rate of exactly 100, and at 34, his international future seemed in doubt.

What makes his ascent even more remarkable is that he represents unglamorous Vidarbha in the Plate League of the Ranji Trophy.

While he made waves in the domestic scene, Umesh really caught the eye during IPL 2010, where he impressed a much wider audience with his pace for Delhi Daredevils. He finally broke into the big league, when he was flown to the West Indies as a replacement for the injured Praveen Kumar during the World Twenty20 tournament in May 2010, and earned his first call-up to the India Test team for the tour of South Africa in November the same year. He made the Test playing XI for the first time against West Indies in Delhi in November 2011, and picked up nine wickets in his first two Tests, which in turn earned him a place for the Australia tour.

More than his figures though, it was his speed and aggression that stood out. However, 2012 was an injury-prone year for him: he picked up a shin injury in Australia, before being ruled out one Test into the England series at the end of the year with back trouble.

Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League. \n', 'Hasan made a smooth transition to international cricket, grabbing two five-fors in his first 15 ODIs and impressing with his tight lines on his Test debut - which coincided with the farewells of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan - as Pakistan pulled off a last-gasp win in Dominica. Still, no one could quite imagine the impact he would have on his first global tournament, the 2017 Champions Trophy.', ""Much like his team, Hasan began the tournament badly, going for 70 in his ten overs in a heavy opening-match defeat to India, before turning his form around in unexpectedly dramatic manner. Taking three wickets in each of Pakistan's next four matches, he finished as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 13 at an average of 14.69, while only conceding 4.29 an over. Hasan's ability to strike regular middle-overs blows was a key factor in Pakistan lifting their first global ODI trophy since the 1992 World Cup, and his Player-of-the-Tournament award richly deserved."", '\n']",[],9.0,15,5,155,29,15.5,165,93.93,0,0,18,8,4.0,0.0,44.0,22,6,203,59,12.68,198,102.52,0,2,13,10,12.0,0.0,29.0,9,4,61,23,12.2,35,174.28,0,0,3,5,7.0,0.0,38.0,56,18,594,50*,15.63,840,70.71,0,1,67,21,15.0,0.0,67.0,37,10,375,59,13.88,347,108.06,0,2,27,21,24.0,0.0,91.0,37,14,229,35,9.95,149,153.69,0,0,13,16,25.0,0.0,9.0,17,1737,896,31,May-45,Jul-83,28.9,3.09,56,1,1,0,44.0,43,2125,1862,77,May-34,May-34,24.18,5.25,27.5,1,3,0,29.0,29,597,835,34,Mar-23,Mar-23,24.55,8.39,17.5,0,0,0,38.0,63,7175,4020,157,8/107,Nov-94,25.6,3.36,45.7,7,9,2,67.0,66,3251,2825,121,May-34,May-34,23.34,5.21,26.8,5,3,0,91.0,90,1974,2472,122,May-20,May-20,20.26,7.51,16.1,4,1,0

He doesn't flight his offbreaks much, but his excellent control over line and length allows the captain to use him at almost any stage of an innings. He is also one of the better fielders in the Pakistan team, especially in the point region."", 'Despite these skills, Hafeez failed to create a regular place for himself in the Pakistan in his first seven years in international cricket, primarily due to his inability to convert his starts into substantial scores. He scored plenty of pretty 30s and 40s, laced with some exquisite cover-drives, but that only helped cement the opinion that Hafeez may forever remain a player whose potential exceeds performance.', ""To a large extent, that changed in 2011, as Hafeez put in consistent displays with both bat and ball in all forms of the game. It actually started in the series against South Africa in November 2010, and then continued through 2011, a year which fetched him two centuries in Tests and three in ODIs, apart from two fifties in Twenty20 internationals. He won an incredible ten Man-of-the-Match awards in international cricket that year, and became only the third cricketer - after Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis - to score 1000-plus runs and take 30 or more wickets in ODIs in a calendar year. With Taufeeq Umar, he formed Pakistan's most stable opening combination in Tests, as his aggression at the top of the order became a perfect counterfoil to Taufeeq's defensive approach. "", ""Since then, Hafeez has continued to frustrate and amaze, and the frequency with which he can switch from one mode to the other is a large part of his enigma. By many metrics, he's one of Pakistan's most prolific cricketers, but arguably also one of the more profligate ones in the way he's handled his immense talent. "", ""The elegance of the full face of his bat, particularly when driving through the off side, means any runs he scores are more memorable than they otherwise might be - and there have been plenty of them; he's number 10 on the all time ODI runs list for Pakistan. There was a century against India in Dhaka that preceded a disappointing barren spell, and then a purple patch against Sri Lanka where he smashed three hundreds in four games in 2013. A swashbuckling unbeaten 57 against India in the Champions Trophy final may ultimately be his most famous innings, as it powered Pakistan to a total they wouldn't let India get close to. "", 'It is his usefulness with the ball, though, that has kept him lingering around the Pakistan setup for so long. His consistency gives his side another option, which explains the reluctance to drop him even when his stock skill - batting - is letting him down. He has opened the bowling for Pakistan on several occasions - particularly in T20 cricket - and briefly took on the mantle of lead spinner after Saeed Ajmal was banned for an illegal action. ', 'That curse, however, has plagued Hafeez throughout his career too, and he has found himself suspended for an illegal bowling action no less than three times. Tellingly, it is in those periods that his place in the side has been in the greatest peril, as his technical flaws as a batsman appear destined to go largely unremedied. He was ignored for a recent series in Zimbabwe, but for a player with 50 Tests, 200 ODIs, a shade under 100 T20Is, and countless comebacks, one would have to be particularly brave to be writing his eulogy just yet.

Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing.  \n', 'He began in 2009 with an impressive showing on the domestic circuit, impressing with his whippy pace and swing. He took 55 wickets for National Bank of Pakistan in his debut season, and earned selection to the Pakistan World T20 squad. There he hit the big time, taking over from an out-of-sorts Sohail Tanvir and bowling with pace, accuracy and courage. ', ""He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. "", 'He picked six wickets on Test debut in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, over tours to New Zealand, Australia and England, he matured remarkably, building up his pace and both new-ball and reverse swing. The 2010 tour of England saw the best of him and he became the youngest bowler, at 18, to take 50 Test wickets. But his world crashed around him when he was implicated in a spot-fixing scam in which it was alleged that he had bowled deliberate, pre-planned no-balls in a Test. In February 2011 he was handed a five-year ban following investigations by an ICC tribunal. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to six months in prison at Southwark Crown Court.', ""After his release, Amir frequently expressed his contrition over the incident and co-operated with the ICC in spreading its anti-corruption message. Having been cleared to return to all forms of cricket in September 2015, he made his international comeback the following January, as part of Pakistan's limited-overs squad to New Zealand. On his next international assignment, the 20-over Asia Cup in Dhaka, he made waves once again, rattling India's top order with three wickets in a hostile spell of pace bowling. Amir's reintegration came full circle when he was selected in the Test squad for England later that year, setting up a comeback Test at Lord's, the venue where the spot-fixing scandal had derailed his career six years before."", 'However, it is in Test cricket, the format supposedly perfectly designed for him to express his wizardry, that he has disappointed most profoundly. Magical spells with the new ball have been all too fleeting, and his performances in the three countries where conditions are arguably best suited to him, have been largely indifferent. With the ball, he averaged 42.41 in England in 2016, 28.83 in New Zealand that same year, and 61.60 when Australia whitewashed Pakistan at the turn of the year. The prodigious banana swing from that titillating left-arm angle - and that quite beautiful bowling action - does come, but not nearly as potently or regularly as memory suggests it did in his teenage years. In other words, Amir, in Test cricket, has flattered to deceive. ', ""It depends on what he wants to be remembered for, though, because if he wishes to live for famous moments rather than a stellar career, he's got the biggest one tucked up already. In the Champions Trophy final against India, it was his opening salvo that put the game out of India's reach. Defending 338, he trapped Rohit Sharma in front in the first over, before taking Virat Kohli's outside edge twice in two balls - the first was dropped in the slips. Shikhar Dhawan fell at Amir's hands too, with the fast bowler's figures reading 6-2-16-3, as Pakistan stormed to victory by 180 runs. \n"", '\n']",[],36.0,67,11,751,48,13.41,1980,37.92,0,0,91,3,5.0,0.0,50.0,27,9,352,73*,19.55,430,81.86,0,2,31,8,6.0,0.0,42.0,11,4,44,21*,6.28,58,75.86,0,0,1,2,4.0,0.0,66.0,100,15,1334,66,15.69,3007,44.36,0,2,164,12,15.0,0.0,72.0,35,15,402,73*,20.1,500,80.4,0,2,36,8,11.0,0.0,122.0,45,20,180,21*,7.2,196,91.83,0,0,10,6,11.0,0.0,36.0,67,7619,3627,119,Jun-44,Jul-64,30.47,2.85,64,6,4,0,50.0,50,2473,1971,60,Apr-28,Apr-28,32.85,4.78,41.2,1,0,0,42.0,42,936,1066,55,Apr-13,Apr-13,19.38,6.83,17,1,0,0,66.0,119,12214,5786,254,Jul-61,Oct-72,22.77,2.84,48,10,13,2,72.0,72,3650,2805,101,May-36,May-36,27.77,4.61,36.1,1,1,0,122.0,120,2688,3025,147,Apr-13,Apr-13,20.57,6.75,18.2,3,0,0

He made his international debut in early 2008, in the home ODI series against Zimbabwe, and though he did reasonably well in his early games, he was dropped in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half years away from international cricket. He returned with his appetite suitably whetted, and 2012 was a particularly memorable year for him, as he scored two ODI hundreds against India, and followed up with one more early the next year to firmly establish himself at the top of the order. An aggressive batsman, Jamshed plays strokes all round the wicket, but also backs it up with sound temperament and an ability to convert starts into big scores. \n', ""Jamshed's talent was visible from his junior days, and he made a mark very early in his cricketing career.

Scoring a 44 and a 204 on his debut, he helped his side draw that match after Pakistan had conceded a 253-run first-innings lead. Although he failed to replicate those performances for the remainder of the season, he remained part of the NBP squad as well as representing Lahore. Jamshed was also part of the Pakistan U-19 squad that successfully defended its title in 2006, beating India by 38 runs."", ""Jamshed's break, however, came in the 2007-08 season where he scored 800 runs in ten Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches with the help of three centuries and was selected to play for the Patron's XI side that took on the touring Zimbabweans. A 182 off only 240 deliveries was enough for his name to be shortlisted for the 15-probables for the ODI series.

Instead, he became the first Pakistan captain since the great Imran Khan to win a 50-over world title.  \n"", 'Sarfraz took over the ODI reins in February 2017, providing his side with rare single-minded direction and focus. In June that year, Pakistan went into the Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked team and lost heavily against India to start off, but then went on a red-hot run to beat South Africa, Sri Lanka and hosts England, and finally India to claim the prize. ', ""A right-hand middle-order batsman, Sarfraz wasn't always the sprightly presence that bossed the Sharjah Test of 2014 - when Pakistan chased 302 in 57.3 overs to level the series. In fact, between 2007 - when he made his debut - and 2014, Sarfraz had played just four Tests, four T20Is and 26 ODIs. He was miles off being a regular in any of Pakistan's sides, and not nearly good enough to warrant a place as a specialist batsman; he hadn't scored an international half-century in all this time. It was an era when the Akmals - no less than three of them - had taken out a lease on the area behind the stumps. "", ""Sarfraz had appeared on Pakistan's radar initially by leading Pakistan's Under-19s to the World Cup title in 2006, scoring half-centuries in his third and fourth match. He broke into domestic cricket, where 523 runs in 10 matches along with 28 dismissals behind the stumps pushed him into the A team's tour of Australia in 2007. Then he was left in the wilderness. "", ""It took seven long years for the spotlight to return to Sarfraz, when he made 74 in Pakistan's total of 359 in the second innings against Sri Lanka in Dubai. The innings was in a losing cause, but it did establish him as the team's first-choice wicketkeeper. He averaged 71.20 over the next 18 months, and during this period also elbowed his way into the ODI side midway through the 2015 World Cup campaign with a run-a-ball 49 against South Africa. "", ""Since then, Sarfraz has been a man for all formats, steady with the gloves, aggressive with the bat and street-smart as a captain across formats.

Saqlain Mushtaq was perhaps the first offspinner to master the doosra, a\ndelivery that spins away from the batsman even though it is delivered\nwith an offspinner's action. Saqlain has a fast, short-stepping action with a halting delivery, and has a propensity to bowl no-balls, unusually for a bowler with such a short run. He is criticised for attempting too much variation and he often throws in the doosra the first time a batsman faces. Saqlain's international career got off to a splendid start - he was the fastest bowler to 100 one-day wickets, and his phenomenal control meant that he regularly bowled at the death. But his finest moment arguably came in a Test match, at Chennai in 1998-99, when his ten-for allowed Pakistan to sneak nerve-tingling 12-run win against India. However, his stock has fallen a long way since then, with Shoaib Malik, a better batsman than Saqlain, usurping the spinner's spot in the ODI line-up and Danish Kaneria becoming the frontline Test spinner. Saqlain did get an opportunity to have a go at the Indians again in the 2003-04 series, but unflattering figures of 1 for 204 at Multan meant that he was quickly consigned to the scrap heap. He was unable to force his way back ahead of Danish Kaneria and he was blighted by injury after a prolific time with Surrey. However, his career was given a lifeline in 2007 when he joined Mushtaq Ahmed at Sussex and there was even talk of him qualifying for England. That could remain a distant dream, after signing a contract with the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League.

Ajmal didn't play his first Test till almost 32, but showed immediately that he belonged, taking five wickets in his debut Test against Sri Lanka in Galle in 2009.  \n"", 'His golden run, though, started in 2011, when he showed superb control over all his variations - the offspinner, the doosra and the subtle changes in speed and flight. Unlike many offspinners who change their line when bowling the doosra, Ajmal tends to bowl the offspinner and the doosra from around the same line - on or just outside off - which makes it much tougher for batsmen to pick his variations. In 2011 he was the leading wicket-taker in Tests, with 50 in eight matches. But the best series of his young career came early in 2012, when he destroyed the batting line-up of the best team in the world, England, taking 24 wickets in just three games at 14.70. In the process, he clearly won the battle of offspinners against the highly rated Graeme Swann. ', "" However, Ajmal first made his mark in international cricket in ODIs. He was called up for the 2008 Asia Cup, and soon after he had the Australians completely bewildered in the ODI series in the UAE; he gave away few runs and his doosra was almost unreadable. The ICC called him for his action, though it was cleared soon after. The pressure didn't get to him and immediately after, he played a crucial role in Pakistan's drive to the 2009 World Twenty20 title, regularly bottling up the middle overs with Shahid Afridi. He ended the joint second-highest wicket-taker in the tournament, with an exemplary economy rate as batsmen around the world struggled to get a read on his bag of tricks.

A Test average of over 50, a triple-hundred, a famous double-hundred against India in India, and a brilliant rearguard partnership to clinch Pakistan's 3-0 Test whitewash over England, leave no doubt about his quality and class. He is also one of the most successful fielders for Pakistan, and can bowl respectable slow-medium. As a captain, Younis has enjoyed success in leading Pakistan to the world Twenty20 title in 2009.\n \nMuch of his persona evokes the idea of the quintessential Pathan warrior - committed, inspired, capable, and bearing the burden of conflict with fortitude and poise. Born in Mardan, a prominent city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Younis moved at an early age to Karachi, where he caught the eye of Rashid Latif and Saeed Anwar at Malir Gymkhana, one of the city's renowned sports clubs. The relationship with Latif blossomed into a nurturing mentorship, guiding Younis towards entry onto the world stage. After two impressive domestic seasons, he got a Test call-up, and marked it with a century on debut.\n \nStyle and aesthetics are not his strongest points. His technique relies on a good deal of bottom hand, which deprives it of the fluidity and grace that is typical of Asia's best batsmen. Yet when Younis gets going, he produces results in the face of steep odds.\n \nIndeed, the steeper the odds, the more Younis seems to thrive. His match-winning 267 and 84 not out in Bangalore came after a string of low scores prompted a sarcastic comment from the team manager that leaked into the media. His greatest captaincy feat - the world Twenty20 championship in England - was achieved weeks after Pakistan cricket had been devastated by the terror attacks in Lahore. And though his triple-century came at home on a flat track, the innings began under pressure when Younis, eschewing the nightwatchman, stepped out himself in the dying moments of the second day with Pakistan staring at a huge Sri Lankan total. Unsurprisingly for a rearguard specialist, Younis has emerged a master of the fourth innings. Among players with 1000 or more fourth-innings Test runs, his average is among the highest.\n \nAlong with these accomplishments, Younis's career has also seen turmoil. Inability to control infighting within the team and display tact with the PCB led to him losing the captaincy in late 2009, and he effected a moody refusal when circumstances changed and it was offered again. His nature is to be inward-looking and intensely focused, quietly fighting his way through. While this makes for a reclusive personality that shuns the media and runs afoul of officialdom, it has also been the source of Younis's batting strength and his extraordinary resilience as a cricketer."", ' \n']",[],118.0,213,19,10099,313,52.05,19375,52.12,34,33,1082,70,139.0,0.0,265.0,255,23,7249,144,31.24,9628,75.29,7,48,578,56,135.0,0.0,25.0,23,3,442,51,22.1,364,121.42,0,2,31,12,12.0,0.0,229.0,385,42,17116,313,49.9,,,56,64,,,243,0,351.0,331,36,9911,144,33.59,,,12,64,,,196.0,0.0,83.0,78,17,1864,71*,30.55,1589,117.3,0,10,144,37,34,0,118.0,31,804,491,9,Feb-23,Apr-50,54.55,3.66,89.3,0,0,0,265.0,20,284,288,3,01-Mar,01-Mar,96,6.08,94.6,0,0,0,25.0,1,22,18,3,Mar-18,Mar-18,6,4.9,7.3,0,0,0,229.0,,3620,2120,44,Apr-52,,48.18,3.51,82.2,,0,0,351.0,,1169,1127,28,03-May,03-May,40.25,5.78,41.7,0,0,0,83.0,7,104,136,6,Mar-18,Mar-18,22.66,7.84,17.3,0,0,0

He loves to make room and thrash the ball through the off side, but the stroke that bears his signature more than any other is the one he developed for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 - the eponymously named ""Dilscoop"" shot over his head, which confounded bowlers and experts alike. \n', 'In fact, 2009 was a watershed year in his career, and a huge factor was his move up the batting order to open the innings in all three forms of the game.

Having burst onto the international scene with an unbeaten 163 against Zimbabwe in his first series in November 1999, Dilshan's career remained largely unfulfilled until he cemented his place as one of the most destructive openers in the modern era. Add his electric fielding, especially at backward point, and his underrated offspin, and Dilshan is a quality package. In 2011 he was named Sri Lanka's captain, after the resignation of Kumar Sangakkara, but his reign lasted less than a year, with Mahela Jayawardene replacing him after Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12. Like his team, Dilshan had had a poor run of form while he was captain, but his batting enjoyed a revival after being relieved of leadership, particularly in ODI cricket, where he was 2012's second-heaviest scorer, with 1119 runs. \n"", ' ']",['ICC Twenty20 International Performance of the Year 2009'],87.0,145,11,5492,193,40.98,8379,65.54,16,23,677,24,88.0,0.0,330.0,303,41,10290,161*,39.27,11933,86.23,22,47,1111,55,123.0,1.0,80.0,79,12,1889,104*,28.19,1567,120.54,1,13,223,33,31.0,2.0,233.0,384,24,13979,200*,38.83,,,38,59,,,356,23,449.0,416,54,14314,188,39.54,,,30,71,,,204.0,8.0,221.0,217,25,5193,104*,27.04,4228,122.82,1,34,633,110,79,3,87.0,76,3385,1711,39,04-Oct,04-Oct,43.87,3.03,86.7,1,0,0,330.0,204,5880,4778,106,04-Apr,04-Apr,45.07,4.87,55.4,3,0,0,80.0,25,258,313,9,02-Apr,02-Apr,34.77,7.27,28.6,0,0,0,233.0,,6501,3255,90,May-49,,36.16,3,72.2,,1,0,449.0,,7871,6303,152,04-Apr,04-Apr,41.46,4.8,51.7,4,0,0,221.0,116,1564,1892,64,Mar-16,Mar-16,29.56,7.25,24.4,0,0,0

His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype.

Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.', 'Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.', ""In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews. "", 'His limited overs batting has improved with age, and an increasing stroke repertoire has seen Jayawardene become almost as impressive an innovator at the crease, as he is a technician. An unbeaten 103 from 88 balls in the 2011 World Cup final made plain his limited  overs prowess, and marked him out as a big-match player, having already made a century in the semi-final of the same tournament four years ago. \n']",['ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2013'],149.0,252.0,15.0,11814.0,374,49.84,22959.0,51.45,34.0,50.0,1387.0,61.0,205.0,0.0,448.0,418,39,12650,144,33.37,16020,78.96,19,77,1119,76,218.0,0.0,55.0,55,8,1493,100,31.76,1121,133.18,1,9,173,33,17.0,0.0,237.0,383,24,17838,374,49.68,,,51,80,,,305.0,0.0,546.0,509,51,15421,163*,33.67,,,21,95,,,265.0,0.0,222.0,214,27,5479,116,29.29,4150,132.02,3,36,634,136,75,0,149.0,22,589,310,6,Feb-32,Feb-32,51.66,3.15,98.1,0,0,0,448.0,28,593,563,8,Feb-56,Feb-56,70.37,5.69,74.1,0,0,0,55.0,1,6,8,0,-,-,-,8,-,0,0,0,237.0,,3001,1629,52,May-72,,31.32,3.25,57.7,,1,0,546.0,,1280,1146,24,Mar-25,Mar-25,47.75,5.37,53.3,0,0,0,222.0,5,75,97,3,Feb-22,Feb-22,32.33,7.76,25,0,0,0

Think of him now and you think of forearms straight out of a smithy, shots hammered through point and cover and scythes over the leg side. You recall a man who could score equally briskly in every form of the game, who slashed and burned his way through bowling attacks. As with anyone who relied so much on extraordinary hand-eye coordination, there were troughs and lean times, but just as the obit writers got busy, he would produce another innings of supreme power. The bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than sharp turn, became the supporting act, though 440 international wickets should tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did. \n"", ""Following Mark Greatbatch's success at the 1992 World Cup, most teams were rethinking the way they approached the one-day game and Jayasuriya, who had trawled the lower reaches of the middle order till then, had his first stint as opener during the Hero Cup in India in 1993. It was only during a home series against Pakistan the following year that he established himself in the role and by the time the World Cup rolled around 18 months later, he had already chalked up his first century in whites, a frenetic stroke-filled effort in Adelaide. "", ""The years that followed were both prolific and successful. People remember Aravinda de Silva's magical innings from the semi-final and final of  the 1996 World Cup but it was Jayasuriya's withering assaults that deflated India in Delhi and England in the last eight. Soon after, he began to exact as heavy a toll on Test attacks, scoring at such a pace that Muttiah Muralitharan and friends had ample time to work their way through opposition batsmen."", ""After Arjuna Ranatunga's ouster, there was a four-year stint as captain that ended with a semi-final appearance at the 2003 World Cup, and just as the whispers grew about diminishing returns with the bat, he had one of his most successful years in 2004. There was a retirement announcement  in 2006, but he was back within weeks, and the walk off the Test stage came only 18 months later, after a typically cavalier innings in Kandy."", ""The one-day flame continued to burn bright, and took Sri Lanka to another World Cup final in 2007, and he was instrumental in the Asia Cup win of 2008, a couple of months after it had seemed that the selectors' axe had fallen for the final time. The Indian Premier League gave him a new platform to showcase his big-hitting talent, but failure to replicate the success of the first season in subsequent campaigns was the surest sign that time had finally caught up with a man who was still pounding out one-day hundreds at the age of 39. "", 'His election as a Member of Parliament in April 2010 and his subsequent failure at the World Twenty20 suggested that his international career may be at an end, but he made the longlist for the 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, before being recalled to the one-day side for the series in England two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.']",['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 1997'],110.0,188.0,14.0,6973.0,340,40.07,,,14.0,31.0,910.0,59.0,78.0,0.0,445.0,433,18,13430,189,32.36,14725,91.2,28,68,1500,270,123.0,0.0,31.0,30,3,629,88,23.29,487,129.15,0,4,76,23,4.0,0.0,265.0,419,33,14819,340,38.39,,,29,70,,,162.0,0.0,557.0,542,25,16128,189,31.19,,,31,82,,,153.0,0.0,111.0,109,7,2317,114*,22.71,1654,140.08,1,12,252,114,21,0,110.0,140,8188,3366,98,May-34,Sep-74,34.34,2.46,83.5,6,2,0,445.0,368,14874,11871,323,Jun-29,Jun-29,36.75,4.78,46,8,4,0,31.0,24,371,456,19,Mar-21,Mar-21,24,7.37,19.5,0,0,0,265.0,,15275,6808,205,May-34,,33.2,2.67,74.5,,2,0,557.0,,18167,14396,413,Jun-29,Jun-29,34.85,4.75,43.9,12,5,0,111.0,92,1593,1983,77,Apr-24,Apr-24,25.75,7.46,20.6,1,0,0

That he is a rare talent has never been in doubt, but in international cricket, that raw ability has not usually translated into runs. Perhaps his fans will argue that he was asked to bat too low in limited-overs cricket to have a major impact on the game. Nevertheless, his returns were modest, and his place in the side became untenable, for a few years at least.  \n', 'Kapugedara has, however, enjoyed something of a renaissance in T20 cricket, after he was picked in the national side again in 2015. He impressed initially during his second coming, but another round of mixed results saw him in and out of the team. Despite having played top-level cricket for over a decade, he is still relatively young, and it is hoped he may yet come good as a consistent player. ', ""Naturally aggressive, and capable of clearing the boundary, Kapugedara had been one of the few genuinely exciting batsmen the selectors unearthed from Sri Lanka's Under-19 set-up. From the age of 11, when he first turned out for Dharmaraja College in Kandy, Kapugedera had hardly wasted an opportunity to push himself up the ladder. He had captained all the junior school sides from the U-13 to the first XI. Following a prolific 2003-04 season, where he scored over 1000 runs, he was picked for the U-19 tour to Pakistan the following year and had excelled with a stunning knock of 131 in a one-dayer against the world champions. "", 'It was an innings he had rated as one of his best although he batted equally well for 70 in his first game for Sri Lanka A against the strong New Zealand A team in 2005. The selectors, desperate to unearth new talent, eventually gambled on an early promotion and fast-tracked him into the national squad after several glowing reports from development coaches.', ""Kapugedera's father, also a former Dharmaraja cricketer, provided early coaching and all the encouragement he needed to develop. David Karunaratne (his first coach) and Sumithra Warnakulasuriya (his U-19 coach) also played important roles in shaping Kapugedera's career. He was first picked in the national squad against India in November but pulled out of the tour with an injury.

For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed. \n"", ""Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes. "", 'The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.', ""Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa. "", 'Backed to the hilt by Arjuna Ranatunga, he blossomed in the late 1990s, and there was a period when the opposition routinely budgeted for 20 Murali wickets or more in a three-Test series. As the years passed, his shyness gave way to a quiet confidence and wry sense of humour, and he won admirers around the world for the energy, time and money that he invested in reconstruction after a tsunami had devastated the Sri Lankan coast in 2004. Often the only Tamil in the side in a time of ethnic conflict, he became as powerful a unifying force as any in the country.

He has risen quickly since earning wide acclaim with an acrobatic save in the 2009 World Twenty20, and in February 2013, became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years.  \n"", ""In limited overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills are almost indispensable. When he pulled a quad in the World Cup semi-final in 2011, he forced three changes to the XI that played in the final, as the team strove for the balance he single-handedly delivers. He began his international career with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but has since given primacy to his batting, and effectively plays as a specialist batsman in the Test side. "", ""Often coming to the crease at No. 6, Mathews provides solidity to the lower-middle order, which had been a weakness for Sri Lanka prior to his arrival. In ODIs he has provided two unforgettable finishes - against Australia in 2010, and Pakistan in 2012 - stealing victory with a sublime, sustained assaults, but his best work has come in the Test format. In an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1160 runs at an average of 77.33, Mathews' finest moment was the rousing 160 at Headingley, which transformed that match and saw Sri Lanka win their first Test series in England (not including the one-off Test in 1998). "", ""Mathews' appointment to the captaincy has heralded a renewed focus on youth and development by the Sri Lanka selectors.

That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise. \n"", 'Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. ', 'Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.', ""But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014."", 'It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan\'s farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his ""chronic knee injury"" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL\'s iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.', ""Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight.

He began with a promising 54 on his ODI debut against Australia. His mannerisms while batting - particularly bow-legged stance and the flamboyant cover drives - immediately attracted comparisons with the great Aravinda de Silva. But despite being prodigiously talented, he failed to nail down a regular place during tours to Sharjah (1999), Zimbabwe (1999), Pakistan (2000) and England (2002). After the England tour he dropped out of the selectors' radar and returned to domestic cricket where he captained Panadura Cricket Club. Over the next four years he was a prolific run-scorer, especially after a move to Sebastianites for the 2004-05 season. Eventually he caught the eye of Tom Moody, who could not understand why he was not in the national squad. A quick promotion back into the Sri Lanka A team followed and after a successful tour to India he won a long overdue international recall. Still just 27, he was a surprise selection for the New Zealand tour and was handed his maiden cap in the first Test at Christchurch. It was an inauspicious start as he bagged a pair and Sri Lanka lost by five wickets. Sri Lanka's team management, however, kept faith for the second Test in Wellington and he rewarded them handsomely, scoring 61 in the first innings and a magnificent unbeaten 152 in the second.

In his second avatar he has added more strokes to make his batting more well-rounded, but what Samaraweera does best is wear bowlers down through patient and relentless accumulation. His batting is built around reserves of resilience, determination and sheer toughness, and he had to draw into them all to overcome the trauma of cricket's darkest hours - the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore. \n"", ' \nSamaraweera will forever be remembered for not letting a bullet injury end his international career. He was in his best form, having scored two consecutive double-centuries in Pakistan, when his team bus came under fire in March 2009 and a bullet penetrated 12 inches into his left thigh. He needed surgery and spent three months dealing with the physical and mental wounds of his ordeal. That Samaraweera returned to play his 50th Test in July was a triumph of his strength of character.', '  \nHis return was a second coming after he had begun his career with a hundred on debut against India in 2001. The retirements of Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillakaratne gave Samaraweera a run in the middle order but indifferent form in 2006 led to him being dropped. He returned 18 months later, a more aggressive, prolific batsman and yet remained as solid as he was before, reigniting his career with a century against India in July 2008. It was the beginning of a purple patch which continued even after his run-in with gunmen.', ""Despite all the runs Samaraweera scored, question-marks remained due to his relative lack of success outside the subcontinent. Worse was to follow when he went through a wretched run of form against Australia at home, in 2011. He was subsequently dropped for the Tests against Pakistan in UAE, but defeat in that series forced the selectors to recall him for the South Africa tour. Samaraweera responded in style with two centuries when some of his more illustrious team-mates struggled to put bat to ball. Samaraweera's finest hour came when his century in Durban delivered Sri Lanka their first win in South Africa. "", ""Though he had a moderately successful year in 2012, Samaraweera was the most notable batting failure in Sri Lanka's year-end tour of Australia. Despite scoring plenty of runs in the domestic season thereafter, he didn't find a place in Sri Lanka's squad for the home Test series against Bangladesh.

Having begun his first-class career in 1998-99, it was not until 2006 that he really made his mark.

He finished the three-match tournament with an aggregate of 421 runs, at 105.25, which included two successive undefeated centuries at Eden Gardens. An unbeaten 111 steered his team to the final of the tournament. He then compiled 149 not out in the final against the eventual winners, North Zone.  \n', 'Recognition did not follow immediately.

He scored a career best 243 in the first unofficial Test at his home ground at Colts and followed it up with an unbeaten 104 in the second unofficial ODI to confirm that he could score runs in both forms of the game. His first strides into Test cricket - during the home series against Bangladesh in 2007 - were hardly auspicious, as he was dismissed off his first ball. He returned admirably in his second Test, scoring 82. He followed it up with a century against West Indies in Providence the following year and later made it to the Champions Trophy probables.

He claimed six wickets in the two Tests but his next experience, against South Africa, was a much sterner challenge and he was viciously dealt with by Graeme Smith, AB de Villers and Jacques Kallis. He was on a hiding to nothing but such was the ferocity of the assault one felt for his state of mind, although to his credit he eventually dismissed all three.\n \nZimbabwe's involvement in Test cricket was suspended soon afterward, and Cremer had to wait four years for another chance in the national side, eventually making his one-day debut against Kenya at Mombasa in January 2009.

He was Zimbabwe's youngest first-class player at 15 years 303 days, for Matabeleland in 1998, although that was due to being in the right place when a selected player withdrew at the last minute. Son of international umpire Charles Coventry, he learned his cricket at Whitestone School and Christian Brothers College in Bulawayo, and plays for Bulawayo Athletic Club. He played for the national Under-19 team in the World Cup in 2002, when he was also a student at the CFX Academy. He bats in glasses and most of his successes have been in one-day cricket; he has yet to learn to build major innings in first-class cricket. He favours the lofted drive but as yet lacks the discipline required of a consistently successful batsman. Despite this, he played two Tests against India in September 2005, after the withdrawal of most of Zimbabwe's top players, and did no worse than anybody else.

Chigumbura is a product of the ZC development programme and took to the game at Chipembere Primary School in the Highfield township of Harare. A protégé of coach Stephen Mangongo, he won a ZCU scholarship to Churchill High School and represented Zimbabwe in two Under-19 World Cups.   \n"", ""He made a name for himself at this level when he took four wickets in Zimbabwe's unexpected victory over Australia at the Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh in 2004. Chigumbura was fast-tracked into the Zimbabwe national side in the absence of the 'rebel' players later that year and despite looking out of his depth on Test debut against Sri Lanka, he appeared a much-improved player by the time of the Champions Trophy five months later where he put in a good allround performance against Sri Lanka, scoring 57 and picking up 3 for 37. "", ""Chigumbura was capable of surprising pace before being forced to sit out much of 2005 after sustaining a stress fracture of the back during the South Africa tour in March of that year. He played as a specialist batsman on the West Indies tour in May 2006 due to his injury, and in the home series against Bangladesh which followed and as his bowling recovered consistent, if unspectacular, performances lead to his inclusion in the squad for the Africa XI v Asia XI games in 2007. Chigumbura acquitted himself admirably in the first match at Bangalore, dominating his 67-run partnership with Shaun Pollock with a combative 40. He also played a vital role in Zimbabwe's victory over Australia at the World Twenty20 in South Africa, removing both openers and rotating the strike well as Zimbabwe squeaked home in the final over. "", ""After a year of middling performances in 2008, Chigumbura came into his own in the home series against Kenya in 2009. He tormented the Kenyan bowlers, smashing consecutive scores of 79, 68, 43 and 36 at a strike rate well above a-run-a-ball, and picking up seven wickets for good measure.  He followed that up with a starring allround performance in the first match of the ODI series in Bangladesh, taking three cheap wickets and guiding Zimbabwe home with an unbeaten 60, but could not replicate his form in the remaining games of the series. In March 2010 Chigumbura signed up as Northamptonshire's overseas player for the County Championship and 40-over league."", ""Chigumbura took over as captain of the national side after Prosper Utseya's resignation, having already cut his teeth on the role as Mashonaland Eagles' skipper, but after some initial success - including leading Zimbabwe to the finals of a home tri-series including India and Sri Lanka - Chigumbura's own form fell away alarmingly and in June 2011 he was replaced as captain by Brendan Taylor. He was handed back the limited-overs captaincy in July 2014 as part of ZC's plan to split the leadership between him and Taylor.

Chibhabha has found more success in cricket's shorter formats, where he bats up the order and is also capable of bowling seamers at surprising pace off an apparently leisurely run-up. Coming from the townships, he was well coached under the ZC development programme and has a sound technique against pace, with the discipline to play straight and the courage to take on the short ball, but is not as comfortable against spin. He is a superb fielder, usually in the covers.\n \nHe was fast-tracked into the national side in 2005 after the departure of a slew of senior players, and after an inauspicious start (he made a duck on debut against New Zealand and struggled in the Under-19 Afro Asian Cup) he came good with back-to-back fifties in the opening matches of the tour of the Caribbean in 2006. Consistency was lacking, however, with Chibhabha struggling to convert regular starts into big scores. As such, his appearances for the national side have been marked by their irregularity.\n \nChibhabha captained the Southern Rocks franchise for some time, and was their leading scorer by some distance in the 2009-10 domestic Twenty20 competition. He carried that form into Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa later that year where he scored back-to-back fifties in the T20s, the second of which very nearly helped Zimbabwe to chase down a mammoth 194. Chibhabha moved to Mashonaland Eagles for the 2012/13 season, but the switch didn't immediately to lead to more chances with the national side. He bolted into the team's squad for the 2015 World Cup, however, with a 155 against Canada and a couple of fifties in domestic cricket in the lead-up to the tournament helping his case.\n \nHis sister Julia was the first Zimbabwe women's captain and also the first women's player to be contracted as a coach by Zimbabwe Cricket."", ' \n']",[],3.0,6,0,124,60,20.66,341,36.36,0,1,18,0,0.0,0.0,103.0,103,2,2389,99,23.65,3784,63.13,0,16,226,14,33.0,0.0,33.0,32,0,621,67,19.4,570,108.94,0,5,72,12,9.0,0.0,96.0,178,4,4715,127,27.09,,,6,25,,,55.0,0.0,212.0,209,9,4989,121*,24.94,,,2,33,,,72.0,0.0,83.0,81,3,1895,86*,24.29,1656,114.43,0,14,185,51,26.0,0.0,3.0,4,246,162,1,Jan-44,Jan-44,162,3.95,246,0,0,0,103.0,58,1667,1615,35,Apr-25,Apr-25,46.14,5.81,47.6,1,0,0,33.0,22,323,455,14,Mar-18,Mar-18,32.5,8.45,23,0,0,0,96.0,,6661,3800,123,May-66,,30.89,3.42,54.1,3,2,0,212.0,,3672,3177,91,Apr-25,Apr-25,34.91,5.19,40.3,1,0,0,83.0,59,922,1351,44,Apr-32,Apr-32,30.7,8.79,20.9,1,0,0

But at the other end of that action there have been wickets - and lots of them. A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009. Naturally athletic, he had represented his home province of Manicaland in 200 and 400 metre events while in high school and soon found his calling in cricket.\n \nHe finished the series against the Bangladesh Under-19s in November 2009 as the leading wicket-taker, and represented Zimbabwe Under-19 at the World Cup in 2009-10 before making his senior Zimbabwe debut in the second Twenty20 against India at Harare in June 2010. There was a significant gap in his appearances for Zimbabwe thereafter, but he matured in the A side and in domestic cricket until 2013, when it became plainly apparent that he was one of the best quicks in the country. Chatara took 32 wickets in 18 international games in 2013 and his maiden Test five-for sealed the famous Test win over Pakistan. After Kyle Jarvis' international retirement, Chris Mpofu's fall down the pecking order, and Brian Vitori's susceptibility to injury, Chatara found himself Zimbabwe's senior bowler in 2014 - a role he appeared to take to rather well."", ' \n']",[],9.0,16,2,90,22,6.42,185,48.64,0,0,14,1,0.0,0.0,62.0,41,17,159,23,6.62,327,48.62,0,0,13,2,6.0,0.0,13.0,2,0,15,8,7.5,17,88.23,0,0,1,0,2.0,0.0,51.0,70,17,496,46*,9.35,820,60.48,0,0,65,12,13.0,0.0,129.0,73,34,302,37*,7.74,530,56.98,0,0,19,9,19.0,0.0,47.0,9,3,22,8,3.66,33,66.66,0,0,1,0,15.0,0.0,9.0,16,1695,663,24,May-61,6/106,27.62,2.34,70.6,0,1,0,62.0,62,3037,2636,85,Apr-33,Apr-33,31.01,5.2,35.7,1,0,0,13.0,13,282,351,15,Mar-20,Mar-20,23.4,7.46,18.8,0,0,0,51.0,95,8896,4045,186,Jun-33,Nov-49,21.74,2.72,47.8,5,9,1,129.0,129,6262,5041,190,May-34,May-34,26.53,4.83,32.9,4,3,0,47.0,47,1015,1178,51,Apr-29,Apr-29,23.09,6.96,19.9,1,0,0

He played in the 2003 World Cup but rebelled against the Zimbabwe Cricket Union and left the country in May 2004 for a new life in Australia. He subsequently made his way to England, settled with Hampshire and forged a very successful county career. After 14 years in county cricket, and two games on loan at Derbyshire, he decided to retire as the 2018 season neared its end. He had played an important role in the most successful period in Hampshire's history with seven trophies gathered during his time at the club. \n"", ""A surprise pick for an understrength Zimbabwean side, Ervine made his one-day debut in the fourth match of England's tour in October 2001 at only 18. Ervine was primarily a medium-paced outswinger with a frantic whirling action and a handy lower-order batsman but as his batting stocks increased his bowling fell away. He began to show signs that he was maturing into a genuine international player with a half-century in Perth and further fifties against Bangladesh in Harare. But the second Test in Bulawayo, ruined by rain, proved to be his last. His departure epitomised the player drain which undermined Zimbabwean cricket. "", 'Ervine made an immediate impact with Hampshire, under the captaincy of Shane Warne. He scored consistently as they finished runners-up in the Championship and hit centuries in the semi-final and final (against Warwickshire) of the 2005 C&G Cup to lead his new side to glory, although a ruptured cruciate in the last game of the season had a detrimental effect on his bowling from then on. Further trophies came in 2009, 2010 (when he also made 237 not out against Somerset in the County Championship - the highest score by a Hampshire batsman below No. 6) and a one-day double in 2012. He continued to show his ability in 2014, averaging 45.05 in the Championship as Hampshire gained promotion and made sizeable contributions as Hampshire escaped relegation in 2015 and 2016 (the latter assisted by the ECB who sent Durham down in their place). He ranked his best innings as an unbeaten 84 against Durham to win an unlikely run chase at Basingstoke in 2008. ', ""He flirted with a return to Zimbabwe in 2009-10 when he signed for Southern Rocks where his brother Craig was a regular. His maiden first-class double hundred and a match-saving 178-run partnership with his brother in his comeback match rekindled his love for his home country and it appeared he would return for the 2011 World Cup after being named in Zimbabwe's squad. But weeks before the team departed for India Ervine re-thought his decision and pulled out, opting for the safety of a county contract rather the uncertainty that would come with returning to the country of his birth.\n"", '\n']",[],5.0,8,0,261,86,32.62,471,55.41,0,3,32,2,7.0,0.0,42.0,34,7,698,100,25.85,816,85.53,1,2,62,14,5.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,229.0,358,43,11390,237*,36.15,,,22,57,,,196.0,0.0,251.0,221,30,5716,167*,29.92,,,7,27,,,77.0,0.0,184.0,167,35,3082,82,23.34,2404,128.2,0,10,260,102,59.0,0.0,5.0,6,570,388,9,4/146,4/146,43.11,4.08,63.3,1,0,0,42.0,40,1649,1561,41,Mar-29,Mar-29,38.07,5.67,40.2,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,229.0,,20452,11901,280,Jun-82,,42.5,3.49,73,,5,0,251.0,,7564,7087,206,May-50,May-50,34.4,5.62,36.7,5,2,0,184.0,93,1404,2074,68,04-Dec,04-Dec,30.5,8.86,20.6,2,0,0

A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.\n \nBut it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his family's living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand. The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervine's recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.\n \nAfter spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwe's squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed. \n \nErvine's returns from Zimbabwe's trip to the Caribbean in early 2013 suggested a career heading in the right direction. He averaged 60.50 in the ODIs against West Indies, and was the leading run-scorer across all three formats on the tour. When Zimbabwe returned home, however, Ervine refused a paltry winter contract offer from ZC and instead left the country to play club cricket for Lisburn and Grade Cricket for Morley in Western Australia. It appeared another bright talent had been lost to Zimbabwean cricket, but after an 18-month break Ervine once again made himself available for Zimbabwe ahead of the 2014-15 season. The 2015 World Cup was surely a motivation for his move, and Ervine was included in Zimbabwe's squad for that tournament."", ' \n']",[],15.0,30,2,941,160,33.6,1925,48.88,2,3,113,6,15.0,0.0,84.0,81,11,2176,130*,31.08,2943,73.93,2,12,186,28,39.0,0.0,16.0,15,0,229,42,15.26,287,79.79,0,0,21,2,8.0,0.0,70.0,125,6,4813,215,40.44,,,10,25,,,63.0,0.0,159.0,150,28,4639,168*,38.02,,,8,25,,,67.0,0.0,56.0,50,9,1054,96,25.7,893,118.02,0,6,95,31,26.0,0.0,15.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,84.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,16.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,70.0,,210,143,3,Feb-44,,47.66,4.08,70,0,0,0,159.0,,158,125,1,Jan-25,Jan-25,125,4.74,158,0,0,0,56.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Rather fittingly, in what was a highlight of his career, he went on to lead West Indies to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup with a stirring victory over hosts Sri Lanka in the 2012 World Twenty20 final.  \n', ""Sammy is in fact the first international cricketer to emerge from St Lucia, an island rediscovering its cricket culture as the new Beausejour Stadium has captured imaginations. He won a one-day cap in England in 2004 - although there wasn't actually any play in the match, it counted as the toss was made - and was called up late to the Champions Trophy squad in September 2004 after Jermaine Lawson pulled out with a stress-fractured back. In July 2006, he was named as St Lucia's captain for West Indies' first-ever Twenty20 tournament and was recalled for the tour of England in 2007. After missing the first two Tests, Sammy was drafted into the side for his debut at Old Trafford, and celebrated with 7 for 66 in the second innings - a performance that included three wickets in a single over. St Lucian fans had their first opportunity to see Sammy in an ODI in his home country when he played at Gros Islet against Sri Lanka in 2008. "", ""In the next two years, Sammy struggled to hold down a place in the Test side while remaining a fairly permanent fixture in the one-day team. Playing for a weakened team against Bangladesh in 2009, he ended the two-Test series with 12 wickets. Further success with the ball came on Zimbabwe's tour of the Caribbean in 2010, as he became the first West Indian to take five wickets in a Twenty20 international. West Indies went on to lose that game, but Sammy's bowling in the one-day series which followed - he took eight wickets at 12.50 and an economy rate of just 2.85 - was a major factor in the home side's win. He was also one of the bright spots in West Indies' whitewashing by the South Africans later that year, although this time it was his batting that grabbed the attention: he scored his runs at a strike-rate of 145.31, and registered the fastest ever half-century by a West Indian in the second ODI at North Sound, very nearly snatching an unlikely win. "", ""After Chris Gayle did not sign a central contract in 2010, Sammy was named captain of the Test and one-day teams. He did lead West Indies to their first Test win in two years, taking seven wickets against Pakistan in Providence in 2011, but overall the results were disappointing. Though West Indies won six in a row - against New Zealand (at home), Bangladesh and Zimbabwe - they then lost heavily against India and New Zealand (away). With Sammy's performances with bat and ball being less than impressive, he was replaced as Test captain by Denesh Ramdin in May 2014.""]",[],38.0,63,2,1323,106,21.68,1949,67.88,1,5,157,34,65.0,0.0,126.0,105,30,1871,89,24.94,1870,100.05,0,9,145,84,67.0,0.0,68.0,52,18,587,42*,17.26,398,147.48,0,0,45,31,31.0,0.0,96.0,158,9,3549,121,23.81,,,2,22,,,137.0,0.0,191.0,161,37,3092,89,24.93,,,0,14,,,104.0,0.0,294.0,247,73,3717,71*,21.36,2627,141.49,0,6,245,225,115.0,0.0,38.0,65,6215,3007,84,Jul-66,Aug-98,35.79,2.9,73.9,1,4,0,126.0,119,4956,3851,81,Apr-26,Apr-26,47.54,4.66,61.1,1,0,0,68.0,59,916,1116,44,May-26,May-26,25.36,7.31,20.8,1,1,0,96.0,,13744,6312,217,Jul-66,,29.08,2.75,63.3,6,10,0,191.0,,7654,5850,154,Apr-16,Apr-16,37.98,4.58,49.7,5,0,0,294.0,214,3381,4467,157,May-26,May-26,28.45,7.92,21.5,2,1,0

A former soccer player, he entered cricket folklore with an outfield catch at the SCG one day that would have made any goalkeeper proud. After retiring as a player he moved into coaching, taking charge of Sri Lanka in 2003. His appointment came as a surprise, given that he had little coaching experience at higher levels. However, the players warmed to his style, and in 2004 the team arrested a downward slide. His stint lasted nearly two years, before Tom Moody took over. In 2007, Dyson was interested in the India and Bangladesh vacancies, and he eventually edged out his fellow Australian Dav Whatmore for the post of West Indies coach. His tenure, as those before him will attest to, combined sporadic success with humiliating defeat, while the board continued to fight with and against the players' association. A costly and embarrassing Duckworth-Lewis calculation blunder cost his side a match against England in early 2009, and an horrifically weakened team - owing to another player-board dispute - lost a Test and one-day series to Bangladesh.

Buttler has helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, whilst also reigniting his Test career after a surprise recall by new national selector Ed Smith. \n"", 'Softly-spoken and unassuming, with supple hands and a great eye, Buttler kills opposing attacks with kindness, with a graceful flip shot for six over long-on and the occasional resort to a nerveless ramp shot over the wicketkeeper among his most eye-catching shots in an inventive repertoire. Like his captain, Eoin Morgan, his unflustered response to even the most daunting run chase is one of his greatest assets, his steely resolve hidden beneath a benign exterior. Such was his impact for Mumbai Indians in his first appearance in IPL in 2016, capable of mayhem late in the innings, that for a young cricket follower in India with only Twenty20 in their heart, it was possible to imagine that England had rarely, if ever, produced a player of such star quality. ', ""Buttler was in the crowd at Taunton as a young spectator during the 1999 World Cup when India's Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid thrashed what was then the highest partnership in ODI cricket. He was hooked. Somerset gained special permission from the ECB to add him to their Academy at 12, two years early, and he came to prominence as a 19-year-old in the 2010 season for Somerset, especially in the one-day arena where his clear-minded and quick-footed aggressive batting helped him to 440 CB40 runs at 55.00. He made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Taunton in 2009 and became a regular in the County Championship from May 2010 - playing a part in Somerset's title challenge that season. He combined in particularly potent fashion with Kieron Pollard in Somerset's run to Twenty20 Finals Day in both 2010 and 2011, and impressed in the 2011 CB40 final, making 86 from 72 balls in Somerset's defeat to Surrey."", ""He made his international debut in late 2011 and became a fixture of England's T20 side. A first ODI appearance came against Pakistan in the UAE during the winter, though he had to wait almost a year for his second cap, this time as wicketkeeper. When Ashley Giles took over as limited-overs coach one of his first key decision was to ditch Craig Kieswetter for Buttler on a tour of India. With Kieswetter still preferred as Somerset's gloveman, it was that rivalry that caused Buttler to leave his beloved West Country and switch to Lancashire for the 2014 season. Lancashire saw him for 10 Championship matches, but it was soon apparent he would be making only fleeting visits in the future."", ""England looked to him for impetus and increasingly he delivered, striking 99 against West Indies at North Sound and kicking off the 2014 ODI summer with a first hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's as he led a failed run chase virtually single-handed. When Matt Prior became stricken by Achilles trouble - what proved to be a career-ending injury - the selectors gambled by throwing Buttler into the Test team. He scored five half-centuries in his first eight Tests, including 85 on debut against India at the Ageas Bowl, but his form faltered and he lost the gloves to Jonny Bairstow on England's tour of the UAE in 2015-16, during a period where his keeping started to make necessary improvements but his batting slip away."", ""There were no such doubts about his place in the white-ball teams. His seniority was recognised when he was named Morgan's vice-captain for the 2015 World Cup and, although that tournament was an unhappy one for England, Buttler was a key member of the side that reached the final of the World T20 a year later. His dynamic batting was emblematic of England's one-day reinvention under Morgan, though he also began to demonstrate increased range to his game - when he led England to an extraordinary one-wicket win over Australia at Old Trafford in 2018, his unbeaten 110 from 122 balls was by far the slowest hundred of his career."", ""Amid increasing demand on the T20 circuit, which included spells in the Bangladesh Premier League and Australia's Big Bash, Buttler's Test star seemed to be waning. He was briefly recalled in India in 2016-17 but then spent more than a year on the fringes, and was even overlooked as Bairstow's back-up during the following winter's Ashes tour. However, his stellar form for Rajashtan Royals in the 2018 IPL - he equalled the league record for consecutive fifties - prompted Smith to pick up the phone. Impressive contributions against Pakistan followed, and then, at long last, a maiden Test hundred, recorded in defeat to India at Trent Bridge. Suddenly, Buttler was integral in all three formats once again."", '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2010'],31.0,54,6,1722,106,35.87,2876,59.87,1,14,204,18,68.0,0.0,127.0,105,22,3387,150,40.8,2862,118.34,7,18,289,107,155.0,28.0,66.0,58,11,1260,73*,26.8,912,138.15,0,7,102,53,23.0,4.0,95.0,152,13,4593,144,33.04,7651,60.03,5,29,585,53,184.0,2.0,198.0,165,42,5553,150,45.14,4653,119.34,9,34,512,170,207.0,33.0,241.0,220,41,5397,95*,30.15,3747,144.03,0,36,451,225,127.0,27.0,31.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,66.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,95.0,1,12,11,0,-,-,-,5.5,-,0,0,0,198.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,241.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

A skiddy fast bowler, she represented Yorkshire at Under-15 and Under-17 level, but took a break from county cricket at the age of 17 because she was overweight and not really enjoying the game. \n"", ""But two years later - spurred on by her sister's dramatic weightloss - Brunt was back, leaner and meaner than ever. She moved up from Yorkshire to Super 4s to England as fast as her weight had dropped off - at lightning pace - and both transformations were down to sheer grit and application.\nSo dramatic was her weightloss after a vigorous dieting and exercise regime that some of her new England colleagues didn't recognise her when, aged 19, she turned up for the drawn Test against New Zealand in 2004."", 'A trip to South Africa for the 2005 World Cup followed, although it ended in disappointment for second-ranked England who were knocked out at the semi-final stage by the eventual winners Australia. But Brunt exacted revenge four months later, taking 14 wickets in the two Tests and scoring her first Test fifty besides as England romped to their first Ashes series win in 42 years.', ""A few months later she toured the subcontinent when England visited Sri Lanka and India at the end of 2005, with mixed success. Brunt's own tour ended early when she broke a finger and had to fly home."", 'In fact her career has been blighted by injuries throughout, in particular a troublesome back, which saw her miss the 2007-08 Ashes to recover from surgery. She reignited the injury out in Australia during the 2013-14 Ashes and seriously considered walking away from cricket altogether, but the ushering in of the professional era in May that year allowed her the time and support to fight her way back to full fitness and recover much of her old pace.', ""The recovery time has always proved worth it. A fully fit Brunt has been one of the most powerful weapons in England's armoury, since 2009 becoming England's leading strike bowler with a pace that - at her quickest - has rivalled the fastest in the women's game. Picked in the 2009 50-over World Cup squad, she took six wickets from five games, and was retained for the World T20 later that year, taking a phenomenal 3 for 6 in the final against New Zealand at Lord's as England triumphed."", ""She has particularly shone against Australia, with her 6 for 69 in the first innings of the 2009 Worcester Test helping ensure that England retained the Ashes. In the new format women's Ashes in 2013 she took nine wickets at an economy of 3.02 across all three formats. The improvement in her batting was also apparent in the 2015 Ashes series, when she top-scored with 39 for England in the first innings of the Canterbury Test. It may well be that she is in future years considered a genuine allrounder; yet whether batting or bowling, the same qualities of passion and aggression always shine through."", '\n', '\n']",['ICC Spirit of Cricket Award 2014'],11.0,14,4,156,52,15.6,506,30.83,0,1,21,0,3.0,0.0,116.0,64,17,771,72*,16.4,985,78.27,0,2,68,8,33.0,0.0,67.0,36,18,302,42*,16.77,277,109.02,0,0,22,8,19.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11.0,19,2082,852,39,Jun-69,9/111,21.84,2.45,53.3,1,2,0,116.0,114,5721,3321,144,May-18,May-18,23.06,3.48,39.7,2,5,0,67.0,67,1461,1253,66,03-Jun,03-Jun,18.98,5.14,22.1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His new-ball partnership with James Anderson has sustained England's Test attack for years, his own aggression and ability to flog bounce from all but the most benign surface dovetailing nicely with Anderson's technical excellence. And as Anderson continued to set new landmarks, Broad followed ably in his slipstream, emulating his friend when becoming only the second Englishman to take 400 Test wickets. \n"", ""Broad has been blessed with one remarkable career performance. However long he plays, surely nothing will come close to the first session of the Ashes Test of 2015, on his home ground of Trent Bridge, when he took 8 for 15 as Australia were bowled out before lunch, in only 18.3 overs, for 60. This was Australia's ultimate humiliation - a beating as raw and ridiculed as the 5-0 larruping from 18 months earlier that England were on their way avenging. Broad's incredulous hands-to-mouth expression as Ben Stokes plucked a catch at fifth slip became the picture of the summer."", 'Broad has always been a bowler capable of a hot streak. On the occasion of his 100th Test in November 2016, he had taken five wickets in a single spell seven times. On such occasions, he runs in hard and his menace visibly grows. His combative fast bowling and volatile temperament (comparisons have been made with Draco Malfoy, a Harry Potter baddie) has been one of his great strengths as well as periodically bringing criticism about his behaviour, but the respect in which he is held was amplified when England recognised his desire to succeed and ability to think on his feet by appointing him as Twenty20 captain. He led the side on 27 occasions between 2011-15 before England, with an eye to the preservation of a vital player, utilised him increasingly as a Test specialist.', 'Despite being carted for six sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh at the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, his stock continued to rise on tour with England in Sri Lanka when his 11 cheap wickets helped them to a 3-2 one-day series victory. He was then called up for the subsequent Test series, making his debut on a slab of Colombo concrete and toiling for 36 sweaty overs. The subsequent tour of New Zealand proved to be his real chance, however. With Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison both lacking form, he was selected for the Wellington Test. The decision taken by his coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan was soon vindicated.  ', 'Broad was already shaping up as the Next Big Thing of English cricket when he pushed his career into overdrive in a sensational spell of bowling in the fifth and decisive Ashes Test at The Oval in 2009. With the series in the balance, Broad claimed figures of 5 for 37 in 12 overs, including 4 for 8 in 21 balls, and after that there was no coming back for Australia.', 'He was struck by injury for the first time in the 2010-11 winter, ruled out of the last three Ashes Tests before breaking down again during the World Cup. However, his significance in England\'s future was confirmed when he was named Twenty20 captain. A slump in form almost cost him his Test place for the visit of India - a period when he was misguidedly imagined in the ""enforcer"" role - but, having survived the cut, he responded with a Man-of-the-Series display, including the first Test match hat-trick to be recorded at Trent Bridge, in a spell of 5 for 5: another trademark burst.', ""Broad's form with the ball was one of the few positives as England suffered a 3-0 whitewash against Pakistan in February 2012 and he began the domestic Test season in splendid form, against West Indies at Lord's, taking 7 for 72 in the first innings, which made him only the eighth player to earn the distinction of being on two honours boards at the home of cricket. His four in the second innings made him the first England bowler to take 10 wickets or more in a match there since Ian Botham in 1978."", 'His subsequent form was less impressive, however. Concerns that he was dropping in pace were alleviated by eight wickets against South Africa at Headingley, but he lost his place on the tour of India, after struggling with a heel injury and failing to take a wicket in either of the first two Tests. But after being fitted with specially designed boots, he showed signs of improvement.', ""That recovery was confirmed against New Zealand at Lord's, as he ripped out 7 for 44 - his best Test figures - and he then almost single-handedly won the Durham Test against Australia with another 11-wicket haul (six in one inspired spell), as England secured their third Ashes series in a row. There was a six-for in the first innings at Brisbane, as England began the return tour in 2013-14 well enough - only to end up being whitewashed for the third time in Ashes history."", 'Broad\'s growing maturity was never more evident. He went to Australia as a marked man, after his butter-wouldn\'t-melt failure to walk at Trent Bridge the previous summer, his nick against Ashton Agar looking all the worse because the ball cannoned off the gloves of wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to first slip. Broad had to withstand a self-righteous debate about ""walking"", a practice which had largely died out for half a century, and he was roundly booed by Australian crowds throughout the winter, but he softened their hostility by good-naturedly soaking up all they threw at him, as well as producing some of England\'s best spells, and emerging as their leading wicket-taker, on a forgettable tour.', ""He was too hostile for India again at Old Trafford in 2014, returned his Ashes eight-for the following year, then treated South Africa to a concerted assault in Johannesburg in 2015-16. Broad's latest five-wicket spell was his first overseas and brought a decisive end to South Africa's proud stint as the world No.1 Test side. When he claimed his 400th Test wicket in Auckland in 2018, he was the youngest man to reach the mark."", ""His batting has flattered to deceive. In 2008, no less a technical purist than Geoffrey Boycott likened his tall elegant batting style to Sir Garfield Sobers, but predictions that he would develop into a fully-fledged allrounder did not come to pass. Nevertheless, he has a remarkable Test hundred against his name, his stand-and-deliver assault on the Pakistan attack at Lord's in 2010, from 102 for 7, bringing him 169 - the highest score by an England No. 9. The Test was later sullied by revelations that Pakistan had bowled deliberate no-balls, bringing lengthy bans for three of their players."", 'In his early cricketing career, Broad played as an opening batsman, following the example of his father, Chris, until he suddenly shot up. Within 18 months he had transformed himself into a beanpole medium-fast bowler, gaining international recognition with the England Under-19 side and establishing himself in the Leicestershire first XI in 2005, beginning a meteoric rise that included an England A debut in only his 11th first-class match in March 2006 and a call-up to the senior one-day side five months later.', ""County cricket figured little for such an England regular but when he played (and often when he wasn't) his commitment was impressive, suggesting a player who had not lost touch with his roots. He moved from Leicestershire to Nottinghamshire, his father's county, in 2008. He bowled with pace and swing to return career-best figures of 8 for 52 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in July 2010, as well as helping them to lift the 2013 YB40 trophy at Lord's - the county's first one-day silverware in 22 years."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2005, 2006, 2007', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2006""]",126.0,183,24,3064,169,19.27,4710,65.05,1,12,377,37,42.0,0.0,121.0,68,25,529,45*,12.3,709,74.61,0,0,35,10,27.0,0.0,56.0,26,10,118,18*,7.37,118,100,0,0,7,3,21.0,0.0,202.0,280,40,4910,169,20.45,7713,63.65,1,24,,,73.0,0.0,151.0,80,28,620,45*,11.92,817,75.88,0,0,42,10,32.0,0.0,85.0,32,12,152,18*,7.6,149,102.01,0,0,10,3,26.0,0.0,126.0,231,25737,12698,437,Aug-15,11/121,29.05,2.96,58.8,16,16,2,121.0,121,6109,5364,178,May-23,May-23,30.13,5.26,34.3,9,1,0,56.0,55,1173,1491,65,Apr-24,Apr-24,22.93,7.62,18,1,0,0,202.0,,38302,19603,710,Aug-15,,27.6,3.07,53.9,28,27,3,151.0,,7496,6591,216,May-23,May-23,30.51,5.27,34.7,9,1,0,85.0,83,1788,2144,100,Apr-24,Apr-24,21.44,7.19,17.8,1,0,0

Before he made a surprise move down the south coast to join Sussex in 2015, he was a key figure in Hampshire's dominance in the 20-overs game, regularly producing economical spells from one of the most rhythmical actions in the game. \n"", ""Briggs' ability in one-day cricket was enough for England to take a look - when he made his international debut in an ODI against Pakistan in Dubai in 2012 he became the youngest Hampshire player to represent England, as well as the first from the Isle of Wight."", ""But thwarted ambitions in Championship cricket provided the impetus for the softly-spoken spinner's move to Sussex at the age of 24. That frustration was illustrated in 2015 when he played only eight Championship matches for Hampshire in a season where they only avoided relegation on the last day of the season - ironically at Sussex's expense. His challenge at Sussex was to find more guile and turn."", ""Briggs first attracted England when he was called up to the England Lions squad for their winter tour of the Caribbean, taking 33 wickets at 18.87 in the Regional four-day Competition, and his continued development meant he was a regular in all formats for Hampshire in 2011. At the end of the season he was rewarded with a call-up to the England T20 squad to face West Indies and was included in England's ODI squad to face Pakistan in the UAE in February 2012, then later the same year for the World Twenty20."", 'When England summoned him for World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, he had to postpone his wedding as a result. The media revelled in that - one tabloid assuring the family that he would turn up for the rearranged date under the headline: ""Aisle Be There."" ', 'All but one of his chances for England have come in the shortest format but the step up to a higher level initially put his left-arm spin under strain. His four overs against New Zealand at the World T20 were carted for 36, his only over in Pune went for 18 and two spells against Australia cost more than 50. ', ""But at domestic level, Briggs has proved himself to be a canny operator and his ability was a crucial factor in Hampshire's appearance in four consecutive T20 Finals Day appearances from 2010. That season he took 3 for 5 in four overs at Canterbury and took what was then a club record 31 wickets as Hampshire lifted the title on their home ground. He became Hampshire's go-to bowler in the shorter format, taking 119 wickets at an average of 19.4 from 94 matches."", ""In the County Championship, Briggs could not rely on a regular place at Hampshire - Liam Dawson, a top-order batsman was often preferred as their spin option. But he occasionally showed what he was capable of - 4 for 93 in a dramatic win over Kent at Canterbury with just minutes to spare secured Hampshire's survival in 2010 - and his best Championship return came in 2014 with 27 wickets at 26.11 as Hampshire were promoted."", 'When he was released early from his Hampshire contract, he had taken 191 first-class wickets in his 67 matches, with a best of 6 for 45 which he took for the England Lions in 2011. His wickets have come at an average of 32.14, with an economy rate of only slightly over 3 runs per over.', ""Briggs' impact at Sussex confirmed that T20 was where his main influence was felt and his economy rate on such a small ground as Hove was exemplary, his alliance with Rashid Khan being a prime reason why Sussex reached the 2018 Blast final. "", 'There was the a maiden-class century to celebrate, too, when he made 120 from 154 balls, batting at No 7, against South Africa A.

6 ft 0 in ",,Allrounder,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium-fast,,,,"['\nAt the height of his powers, Tim Bresnan became known as England\'s lucky charm, but it was in his beloved Yorkshire where he most deeply treasured. Strong-willed, independent and with an understated sense of humour, he perfectly captured the stereotype of the self-made Yorkshire sportsman. ""A doer more than a thinker"" he once said about himself, but he was sharp-witted on and off the field, had an impressive hold on reality and a healthy suspicion of fads and fancies \n', ""A powerfully built allrounder, Bresnan had been tipped for higher honours since he became the youngest player in 20 years to represent Yorkshire when he debuted in 2001. It was nearly a decade later that he really announced his arrival in the big-time, however, with a phenomenal performance in the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2010. Called into the side as a replacement for Steven Finn, and with a remit to keep the runs down, he starred with a performance of skill, pace and unrelenting accuracy. First, he played a key role in bowling Australia out for 98 in the first innings, then he sealed England's successful defence of the Ashes with 4 for 50 in the second innings."", ""Such was his understated value to the side that England won the first 13 Tests he played in - a record bettered only by Adam Glichrist. At that point, having taken eight wickets against West Indies at Trent Bridge, Bresnan averaged 40 with the bat and 25 with the ball but the lingering effects of an elbow injury that required surgery in late 2011 were about to take their toll. He claimed only five wickets in his next five Tests - and two in four against South Africa and India - before undergoing another operation at the start of 2013. He returned to the ODI team for their run to the Champions Trophy final and then picked up four wickets in England's crushing Ashes win at Lord's but his utility had been diminished and he became a victim of England's subsequent Ashes whitewash in Australia, his career limited after that to limited-overs formats."", ""Bresnan began his international career in the England Under-19 set-up and was part of the team in 2002 and 2003 - playing in two World Cups - the same years that he won the NBC Denis Compton Award for most promising Yorkshire player. All the potential took a few years to develop, but 2005 was an important year for him as he was given more responsibility in a transitional Yorkshire team. He was surprisingly overlooked for the England Academy, but started 2006 with a string of impressive performances with bat and ball, leading to a call-up to England's new-look one-day squad to face Sri Lanka. However, he fell victim to the flashing blades of Jayasuriya and co., then suffered injury in the second half of the season as he lost his place for the series against Pakistan."", ""A better all-round summer in 2008 helped him catch the selectors' eyes again, however, and he was called up late in the season for the one-day squad. But after a winter without any honours it appeared he would have to bide his time again before he was surprisingly named in the Test squad to face West Indies. He duly played in both matches, but such was England's dominance it wasn't until the final day of the series that he finally made his mark. He claimed his maiden Test wicket in the second innings and eventual figures of 3 for 45, as West Indies slumped to an innings defeat."", ""While he hovered around the fringes of the Test side thereafter injuries during England's tour to Bangladesh in 2010 opened the door and he impressed, showing good discipline and stamina in trying conditions. He then played an important role in delivering England the 2010 World Twenty20, showing skill and an unfailing ability to hit his straps early to give England control with the new ball, before returning at the end of the innings with steely death-bowling. "", ""Injuries than began to hamper him. A second operation on a troublesome right elbow caused him to miss the 2013 tour to New Zealand. He returned to England's colours adamant that his pace, which he admitted had been reduced because of the injury, had been restored, but it was hard to accept the claim as he struggled like many of his colleagues during England's 5-0 whitewash in Australia in 2013/14. He did not represent England in Tests the following summer. His zip had gone, however, later evidenced by a third elbow operation after the 2016 season. But he committed himself instead to back-to-back Yorkshire Championship wins were his down-to-earth approach, on and off the field, remained highly prized. "", ""An unbeaten hundred against Somerset was his first since 2007 and an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 366 with Jonny Bairstow against Durham at Chester-le-Street - both batsmen making career-best scores - emphasised Yorkshire's might. It was a record stand against Durham, the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in the history of first-class cricket and it is the fifth-highest for Yorkshire, the other four all being opening partnerships. But it was his redoubtable efforts in 2016 that won Yorkshire hearts as much as ever before: Yorkshire conceded the chance of a hat-trick of Championship titles on the final evening of the season, at Lord's, against the side that took their crown, Middlesex, but Bresnan's defiant, unbeaten 142 ensured they did not concede it without a fight in an innings that would enter Yorkshire folklore.

An English icon, full of endless self-belief, he could change the course of a game in an afternoon. With him, England were a side to reckon with; without him they were abysmal  ","[""\nDominant and domineering, Ian Botham was not merely the top English cricketer of the 1980s but the leading sports personality. In an era of discreet footballers - before Paul Gascoigne and David Beckham - he commanded endless newspaper headlines as his career surged improbable heights and bottomless depths. Within a year of being elevated from Somerset to his England debut in 1977, he was undisputed as the country's leading allrounder; within three years he was captain; within four, he had resigned (a minute before being sacked), his form shot to pieces. \n"", ""Then began the most famous few weeks in English cricket history when Botham (under Mike Brearley's captaincy) led England to an astonishing Ashes victory with three performances - two with bat, one with ball - of mystical brilliance. Every  one led to victory and among them they caused a boom in support for English cricket that reverberated through the decade. By the end of it, sober judges were wondering if Botham had done more harm than good by making all England believe, as he did, that cricket matches are won by  inspiration not preparation."", 'Though he remained an international cricketer until 1992, the great days became fewer. As his weight increased, his outswing became less effective. He could still hit a cricket ball with enormous power, but never once did he pass the ultimate exam of his era: scoring a Test century  against the West Indians. Still, he could be mystical. Banned by insistent newspaper demand in 1986 for taking cannabis, he was recalled at The Oval against New Zealand, and with his first and 12th balls took the two wickets he needed to equal and pass Dennis Lillee\'s then-world record of 355 Test wickets. ""Who writes your scripts?"" asked Graham Gooch.', 'His batting was based on sound principles and phenomenal strength; his bowling seemed by then to be more run-in-and-hope, but batsmen remained intimidated by his early reputation to the end.

There is a romance to the art which is liable to leave England selectors swooning so appropriately enough there was an unreal element to Borthwick's Test debut against Australia in the final Test at Sydney as they lurched towards a 5-0 defeat in the 2013/14 Ashes series. \n"", ""Borthwick's addition to England's squad came shortly before Christmas when Graeme Swann, troubled by an elbow complaint, abruptly announced his international requirement, looked around at a lack of obvious pretenders to his crown and pronounced that it was time for the likes of Borthwick to take their chance."", ""Borthwick had shown at Durham that he does not lack bottle, but It was quite an ask for a player who had envisaged a spell in Sydney grade cricket before an England Lions tour of Sri Lanka. He had finished as low as 15th in Durham's Championship averages in 2013, taking only 28 wickets alongside his 1,000 runs, his most impressive strides coming as a batman as Durham shrewdly gave him at opportunity at No. 3. "", '""I still think I\'m a legspinner who bats,"" he nevertheless asserted.  He was preferred to Monty Panesar, used protectively by his captain, Alastair Cook, and four wickets in the match, the best of them to dismiss Chris Rogers on 119, represented an uplifting match return of 4 for 82 in only 13 overs.', ""What followed was a development in his all-round game but a disappointment, nevertheless, for lovers of legspin. Borthwick achieved a rare thing for a Durham player where runs are an expensive commodity - making more than 1,000 in the Division One of the Championship in 2014 and again in a hugely consistent 2015 when only Somerset's James Hildreth made more runs in the top flight - but he took only 28 wickets at expensive cost, cause for England to lose interest. "", ""England's interest flared again when he scored heavily in 2016, responded to a shift up the order to No. 3, but his name check by the national coach, Trevor Bayliss, coincided with a collapse in form. His leg spin was also serviceable at best, and although he put some of that down to the Chester-le-Street pitches, wherever he played he resembled a batsman who bowled. He was proud of his north-east heritage but the club was in financial disarray and after much uncertainty he followed his Durham team-mate, Mark Stoneman, in joining Surrey at the end of the 2016 season. His initial seasons at Surrey were less notable than he would have wished."", ""A product of the local league system in Durham, Borthwick was thrown rudely into the limelight when, live on TV, he was carted for five successive sixes by Essex's James Foster to lose a Pro40 game at the back end of the 2009 season. But, surrounded by a battery of paceman at Durham, he enjoyed a good outing with the pink ball against MCC taking eight wickets in the game to set up his 2010 season. Good form in 2011 earned a call up for England's one-day international with Ireland. He gained further recognition in a T20 against West Indies in August and on tour to India in October 2011.

Admirers of his laid-back approach to life,  and there are many, forever lived in hope that his England career would finish in a blaze of glory, but England's inglorious World Cup campaign in 2015 - and his 120th ODI cap against Afghanistan in Sydney - was where his international story ended. \n"", 'Bopara believers from that point had to take their satisfaction in county cricket and, at Essex, he scored consistently enough across all formats to be in the top ten of run-scorers worldwide over the previous decade: a statistical challenge, along with his 100-plus appearances in all competitions, to those who regarded his career as unfulfilled.', ""In 2002, aged 17, Bopara earned a professional contract with Essex and immediately established himself as a name for the future. He made his first-team debut the same year, playing three Championship matches before being picked for the Under-19 World Cup in 2003. Three years later, his county form was rewarded with a place in England's preliminary squad for the 2006 Champions Trophy and the Academy squad to be based in Perth during the winter's Ashes series."", 'After impressing the selectors, he made his ODI debut against Australia at Sydney, and claimed the wicket of Mike Hussey to help England kick-start their trophy-winning campaign with a 92-run win. A fortnight later at the World Cup in the Caribbean, he showed impressive resolve and class in his maiden one-day fifty against Sri Lanka, albeit in a losing cause. He was one of only a handful of England players to emerge from that tournament with their reputation enhanced, but injury prevented him from building on his success at the inaugural World Twenty20.', 'Three consecutive hundreds against West Indies in early 2009 rebalanced his ledger, only for a difficult Ashes experience to again cost him his place, and he remained on the fringes of the Test side. His form in limited-overs cricket, where his medium-pace bowling is also a useful option, has been more consistent, with some of his most mature displays coming under the ODI captaincy of his Essex team-mate Alastair Cook.', ""Another encouraging display for England in their one-day series against Sri Lanka in October 2007 led to his call-up to the Test squad and he was picked to make his debut in the opening match at Kandy ahead of Owais Shah. It was, on reflection, a tour too soon for Bopara, who scratched 42 runs in three Tests, including three ducks in a row, and was axed the following January. But 14 months later, after flitting around the fringes of the ODI team, he seized his opportunity when Andrew Flintoff flew home from the Caribbean with a hip injury. Picked at No. 6 for the Barbados Test, he responded with a classy 104. Though omitted from the subsequent Test in Trinidad, to accommodate an extra bowler, he was recalled at No. 3 in the return series in England two months later and responded with hundreds in each of his next two innings, at Lord's and Chester-le-Street, to emulate the achievement of his mentor, Graham Gooch, in 1990."", ""A decent showing in the subsequent World Twenty20 confirmed Bopara's place for the Ashes series that got underway in July, but not everyone was impressed with his attitude. After mustering 105 runs in seven innings, he was dropped for the series decider at The Oval, where Jonathan Trott exceeded that tally in a single knock. Two years in the Test wilderness followed, as Eoin Morgan moved ahead of him in the selectors' thoughts, before a return as cover for the injured Trott in the third and fourth Tests against India. Bopara looked on from the sidelines in the UAE as England's batting failed disastrously against Pakistan in 2012 but first a side injury, in Sri Lanka, and then a thigh muscle tear ahead of West Indies' visit, barred him from another crack at Test cricket."", ""When it came, in the South Africa series after some impressive ODI innings against Australia, he quickly withdrew from the squad for personal reasons. He returned for World Twenty20 but still did not seem mentally attuned, as England meekly surrendered the title they won in 2010. His contribution in the 2013 Champions Trophy was more noteworthy, though he couldn't see England home in the final against India. Later that summer, he made his maiden ODI hundred in Dublin, but an Ashes trip to Australia (where he did not play a Test as England were whitewashed) suggested a player whose time might have gone. England's disastrous World Cup showing in 2015 "", 'Essex promised to bring him sustenance as those England opportunities faded. He was appointed as limited-overs captain in 2016 - a shortlived experience he did not particularly relish - and was also a valued signing in various T20 tournaments around the world even if England had turned to batsmen with more explosive strokeplay.\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2007', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2008""]",13.0,19,1,575,143,31.94,1087,52.89,3,0,71,2,6.0,0.0,120.0,109,21,2695,101*,30.62,3462,77.84,1,14,204,34,35.0,0.0,38.0,35,10,711,65*,28.44,599,118.69,0,3,54,17,7.0,0.0,210.0,341,39,12251,229,40.56,23762,51.55,29,52,,,108.0,0.0,315.0,293,56,9666,201*,40.78,,,15,59,,,103.0,0.0,319.0,293,59,6355,105*,27.15,5308,119.72,1,31,495,181,109.0,0.0,13.0,10,434,290,1,Jan-39,Jan-39,290,4,434,0,0,0,120.0,74,1860,1523,40,Apr-38,Apr-38,38.07,4.91,46.5,1,0,0,38.0,21,322,387,16,04-Oct,04-Oct,24.18,7.21,20.1,1,0,0,210.0,,14958,9107,248,May-49,,36.72,3.65,60.3,4,3,0,315.0,,7773,6871,240,May-63,May-63,28.62,5.3,32.3,6,1,0,319.0,241,4211,5274,209,Jun-16,Jun-16,25.23,7.51,20.1,3,1,0

Billings played as a specialist batsman, intended to add panache to the closing overs and to England's outfielding, abandoning the keeping gloves that had helped him to make his name.  \n"", 'He played five ODIs and two T20s without making fifty but he fitted the design of a more high-energy England side. He also featured in one of the quirkier stories of the summer when his Kent teammate Joe Denly tweeted a picture of a supposed lookalike stricken by sunburn when Billings was on England duty and ', ' swallowed the story without a second thought.', ""Billings, well heeled and well spoken, follows a long line of illustrious Kent wicketkeepers including Les Ames, 'Hopper' Levett, Godfrey Evans, Alan Knott and Geraint Jones. His passion for cricket has communicated itself to the Kent crowd in a manner that suggests he might one day stand confidently alongside such exalted company.  "", ""That reputation was enhanced in 2018 when after the potentially disruptive departure of Sam Northeast he led a rejuvenated Kent squad to their first promotion in 11 years and a Lord's final in the Royal London Cup - this despite being largely an absentee captain in early season (Joe Denly deputising) because of IPL and England commitments."", 'He is consumed by sport: an all-round games player who turned down a football trial with Tottenham Hotspur to go on a cricket tour at county level, woke up in an infirmary after being spear tackled in a rugby union game, achieved county junior level in tennis, and is highly adept at squash and racquets - his cousin Tom Billings is high in the racquet world rankings. Regular gym sessions are also part of his routine. No wonder then that he is so fleet footed around a cricket field.', ""An innings of 143 off 113 balls against Derbyshire at Canterbury - the highest one-day total by a Kent batsman at the St Lawrence Ground - was the highlight of a promising 2012 season. Billings had also scored a century, for Loughborough MCCU, on his first-class debut, against Northants in 2011. Having been the county's leading run-maker in T20 as well as CB40 in 2012, he went on an ECB scholarship to Australia over the winter of 2012-13. His burgeoning expertise behind the stumps gave an appealing extra dimension to his game."", 'As a young player at Kent in 2013, undergoing difficult second-season syndrome, Billings even enlisted the help of a company that carries out personality tests, and was persuaded that what he needed to succeed in his career was structure, order and discipline.', ""He replaced Geraint Jones, the former England gloveman, behind the stumps at the start of Kent's 2014 Championship season and emphasised his 50-over potential in the Royal London One-Day Cup, becoming the leading run-scorer in the competition, Only his T20 performances disappointed, the format in which he was soon began to make his name."", 'His growing reputation was illustrated when he called into England\'s 30-man provisional squad for the 2015 World Cup when Craig Kieswetter withdraw with eye problems. That Billings had become a player to be reckoned with was apparent from the moment he blitzed an unbeaten 135 from 58 balls against Somerset in a 50-over tie at Canterbury. Marcus Trescothick, Somerset\'s former England captain, identified Billings as a potential rival for Jos Buttler, quite an accolade considering Buttler\'s Somerset roots, and said: ""Billings absolutely annihilated us.""', ""England came a calling in 2015, with his first international 50 coming in a T20I against Pakistan in Dubai. But he remained on the fringes of the white-ball side, and responded by joining the Indian Premier League auction at the lowest base price of £35,000. Delhi Daredevils decided to take a punt on this unknown Englishman and retained him for 2017 as in flashes he proved himself one of England's finest players of spin and an electrifying fielder. \n"", '\n', '\n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,12,0,271,62,22.58,298,90.93,0,2,29,2,13.0,0.0,21.0,18,0,314,87,17.44,221,142.08,0,2,30,11,13.0,1.0,64.0,95,10,2792,171,32.84,4745,58.84,3,14,398,8,164.0,11.0,90.0,80,13,2708,175,40.41,2569,105.41,6,18,280,47,82.0,8.0,159.0,148,20,3030,95*,23.67,2310,131.16,0,17,259,90,93.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,21.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,64.0,1,1,4,0,-,-,-,24,-,0,0,0,90.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,159.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

He never quite achieved the greatness that some predicted for him as a teenager, but he was a very fine player at international level and English cricket lost a little grace when he played his last Test against Pakistan in Sharjah in November 2015. \n', 'Even after his international days were over, Bell retained that boyish image at the crease for Warwickshire that in the most physically-demanding periods often made him appear a slight and slightly vulnerable figure, but one unfurled cover drive later and his game could flow like few others. ', 'Once described by Dayle Hadlee as the best 16-year-old he had ever seen, Bell had been earmarked for greatness long before he was drafted onto the England tour of New Zealand in 2001-02, as cover for the injured Mark Butcher. He was immediately burdened with similar expectations when he made his England debut. His most fluent early efforts tended to come about when the pressure was off, a trait that belied an average above 40 and a record of a century every five or so Tests.', ""However, on the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, Bell set about changing those perceptions. A perfectly paced century while batting at No. 6 in Durban set England up for an innings victory that ranked, at the time, among their finest overseas performances for a generation, but he surpassed that effort in the very next Test in Cape Town, with a backs-to-the-wall 78 that saved the match and ensured a share of the series. On the subsequent tour of Australia, he continued to save his best for when the chips were down, particularly during England's first-innings struggles at Brisbane and Perth. He finished the tour on a high with his maiden Ashes hundred at Sydney, and a reputation transformed."", 'When in form, Bell was always been adept at leaving the ball outside off stump, and he received glowing reviews from coaches at every stage of his development, not least from Rod Marsh at the England Academy, a man not given to hyperbole. A former England U19 captain, Bell had played just 13 first-class games when called into the England squad, though in 2001 he scored 836 runs for Warwickshire at an average of over 64, including three centuries.', ""He didn't immediately translate that success and talent into runs at the international stage - he was found out by Australia's champions, McGrath and Warne, and mustered just 171 runs in ten innings - but he gradually found his feet and his form at the top level. In 2010 and 2011, he averaged more than 65 in five successive series, including the 2010-11 Ashes. But obviously that run wasn't going to last forever: he was brought back to earth by Pakistan's offspinner Saaed Ajmal in the three-Test series in 2012, managing only 51 runs in six innings."", ""The year was a largely forgettable one in Tests, for Bell and England, though pride was salvaged in India. A first series win in the country since 1984-85 was sealed in Nagpur, where Bell's second-innings hundred made certain of the requisite draw. A reminder of Bell's class came in 50-over cricket, where he made an immaculate transition to opener. That continued into 2013, with his third ODI hundred in lofty Dharamsala, although England were eventually thwarted in their attempts to win global silverware in the Champions Trophy final. He was a casualty of England's grim World Cup campaign in 2015, however, when he seemed unable to translate his talent into the bold stroke-play required and, having been dropped after the tournament, announced his retirement from the format later in the year."", ""His reputation for producing when England needed him in Test cricket, meanwhile, had been all but banished by a series-defining performance in the Ashes of 2013. Bell scored centuries in each of England's three victories, becoming the first man to reach triple figures in three successive Ashes Tests since Chris Broad in 1986 in the process.

He was asleep on an England Lions tour to Sri Lanka when he was summoned to a limited-overs tour in the West Indies as cover for Jake Ball, having taken 10 wickets in two A Tests in discouraging conditions: he failed to get on the field. It was another injury, this time to Steve Finn, which saw England's selectors on the phone again, this time with the invitation to pack for England's 2017/18 Ashes tour."", 'Curran had a decent run during that tour, playing in the last two Tests of the series when the Ashes had already been lost and also winning caps in the other two formats, claiming his maiden five-for in 50-over cricket in Perth as England settled the series. Back in England, though, he had to settle for a summer with Surrey in 2018 (partly explained by a side strain) and watched his younger brother, Sam, won most of the plaudits as he in turn took his England bow.', 'Curran had a sterling season for Surrey in 2015 as they won promotion back to Division One of the Championship and finished as runners-up in the NatWest Blast. The Curran brothers were one of the cricketing stories of the summer and by the end cricket fans knew that Tom was the elder one with the ponytail, showing reliability beyond his 20 years. The ponytail did not last long: Alec Stewart, his stickler of a coach at Surrey, persuaded him to get rid of it before the photographers recorded the young player of the year awards that followed.', ""Curran took most wickets in Division Two, 76 - the same number as Mark Footitt, who won a call-up to England's tour of South Africa - and bowled most overs. The campaign saw him miss just one game, claiming 105 wickets in all three formats with two seven-wicket hauls against Gloucestershire and Northants - counties for which his late father Kevin played. His 76 Championship victims equalled Joey Benjamin's effort in 1994 for Surrey, joint best since Waqar Younis claimed 113 in 1991."", 'He found things tougher the following year as Surrey stepped up to Division One, taking on the workhorse role - his hunched run-up might have been designed for it - and also not spending as much time on his batting as he would have wished to maintain his claims to be a genuine allrounder. England Lions were interested in both him and his younger brother Sam, selecting both for a 2016 tour to the UAE.', 'Having grown up in Cape Town, Tom Curran was spotted by former Surrey captain Ian Greig while playing schools cricket. He was invited to play Second XI cricket for Surrey in 2012, at the age of 17, and took 5 for 21 against Kent in his second game. He also began at Wellington School in September 2012. A month later, tragedy struck when his father, the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin, died suddenly. But Curran decided to remain at Wellington, helped by the school offering his two younger brothers the chance to study there too.', 'Surrey observers were immediately struck by his talent. Fast and generating away swing, former coach Chris Adams even fancifully likened him to Dale Steyn, although he was more robust and not as fast. He took 5 for 34 against Scotland in a one-day game in 2013, but had to wait until 2014 to get his first-class chance in a Surrey attack brimful of pace pedigree. He immediately justified the hype, and also managed the transition between first-class and T20 cricket with astonishing ease for a teenager. The only disappointment was that he failed, in limited opportunities, to show his considerable promise as a batsman.

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit.  \n', ""Curran has belied his slight frame from the moment he entered Surrey's 1st X1 in 2015, showing a natural ability to swing his left-armers at a decent lick and full of ambition with the bat. The combative nature of his cricket has marked him down as a special cricketer in the making, winning attention from England Lions at the end of the 2016 season."", 'Curran made an eye-catching Championship debut against Kent at The Oval when he took five wickets in the first innings, eight in all in the match, at only 17. Surrey research suggested he was the youngest-ever player to achieve a five-wicket haul in the Championship and the second youngest Surrey debutant. He opened the bowling with his brother, Tom, and took a wicket with his fifth ball when an inswinger bowled Joe Denly. At 17 years and 40 days old, his first-class debut came 69 years to the day after Tony Lock, the youngest player to play for Surrey at 17 years and eight days, made his first appearance - also against Kent - at the Oval on July 13, 1946. ', 'A slightly-built, brisk left-armer, he showed an ability to swing the ball into the right-hander from the outset. That there was aggression, too, was evident even before his debut when he filled in for a Surrey T20 practice match and struck Gary Wilson on the helmet with one of the first balls he bowled. His laid-back personality was also evident when he was given a day off school by Wellington College, where he was taking A levels in PE, Art and Business Studies, to play in a Royal London Cup semi-final against Nottinghamshire at The Oval, where he first came to the attention of a wider audience with a composed, energetic display.', ""Two successive runners-up medals in the Royal London Cup final, as Surrey lost Lord's finals against Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, were not a bad start for a player still only 18, but such is Curran's competitive nature, it is doubtful that he found much consolation in either of them. In a 2016 summer that brought so much to admire with bat and ball, there was a career-best 96 against Lancashire - ended when a tame return catch to the offspinner Arron Lilley was followed by a disconsolate walk from the crease, in the words of ESPNcricinfo's reporter, as if he had just lost a game of Pokemon Go - and four wickets in seven ball against Durham on the way to the first six-for of his Championship career."", '\n', '\n']",[],9.0,16,2,454,78,32.42,773,58.73,0,3,47,14,0.0,0.0,2.0,2,0,17,15,8.5,29,58.62,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51.0,78,10,1952,96,28.7,3364,58.02,0,14,269,28,13.0,0.0,51.0,34,5,597,57,20.58,709,84.2,0,1,57,7,20.0,0.0,47.0,36,6,478,50,15.93,402,118.9,0,1,39,16,11.0,0.0,9.0,16,893,513,15,Apr-74,May-92,34.2,3.44,59.5,1,0,0,2.0,2,72,90,2,Feb-44,Feb-44,45,7.5,36,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,51.0,86,6980,3995,133,Jul-58,10/101,30.03,3.43,52.4,5,6,1,51.0,48,2292,2129,68,Apr-32,Apr-32,31.3,5.57,33.7,1,0,0,47.0,46,870,1196,42,Apr-13,Apr-13,28.47,8.24,20.7,1,0,0

In no time, Ballance's nuggety left-handed batting style was providing the backbone of England's line-up. There was nothing overly stylish about his approach, but his discipline and shrewdness was apparent and he could step up the tempo when necessary. Ballance, in the coach's parlance was a batman who Found A Way. \n"", ""Ballance's reputation began to blossom during a run-rich 2013 season for Yorkshire after which he was selected for England's tour of Australia. He made his Test debut in Sydney at the end of England's 5-0 whitewash and followed up an ODI debut in Dublin the previous summer with further limited-overs forays against Australia."", ""But it was 2014, as England sought comfort after the loss of Trott, where England found a batsman to sustain them. A maiden Test hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's was followed by two in successive Tests against India, at Lord's again and Southampton.  Only Trott and Andrew Strauss had previously made hundreds in their first two Tests at Lord's; 1,019 runs at 67.93 in his first 10 Tests ranked alongside the finest starts to an England career.  There was some low-key drunken notoriety as well as he stripped topless in a Nottingham night club to celebrate victory over India at Trent Bridge. "", 'That sense of chubby, red-faced permanence ran aground in 2015 as firstly he lost his ODI place and then New Zealand and Australia, in turn, exposed a shuffling back-foot technique and, amid heavy criticism, he was dropped for the third Ashes Test with his team-mate Jonny Bairstow preferred. Few batsmen played so strikingly deep in the crease, but he insisted that he would remain true to the method that had brought him such success. Such faith did not bring immediate rewards: a return against Pakistan the following summer brought limited rewards before four single-figure scores in Bangladesh consigned him to inactivity on the subsequent five-Test tour of India.', ""Such was the pessimism around his England chances that Yorkshire made him captain in the Championship and he responded with an early-season avalanche of runs, becoming only the second Yorkshire batsman (Younis Khan was the other) to hit a double century and century in the same match, to save the game against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl. With England's top-order failings evident, he gained a reprieve for two Tests against South Africa, that once gilded average now well below 40, and found himself in the Ashes squad for the 2017/18 tour."", ""Ballance's roots are Zimbabwean. Aged just 16, he appeared for Zimbabwe at the 2006 Under-19 World Cup, taking three wickets and top-scoring with the bat in a win over England, the country he had already settled on moving to in order to pursue a career. He took up a sports scholarship at Harrow the same year and his relationship to Dave Houghton (who is married to the cousin of Ballance's father), facilitated several appearances for Derbyshire as a schoolboy, including an innings of 73 in a Pro40 game while still aged 16."", ""At the end of 2007, Ballance signed an academy contract with Yorkshire, allowing him to begin a university course at Leeds Metropolitan University - although he dropped out after a year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 2008, sharing digs for a time with his soon-to-be England colleague Joe Root, but only featured sporadically at first. In 2011, he was one of Yorkshire's better players as they were relegated in the Championship. He added 717 runs at 42.17 in the Championship and 331 runs at 55.16 in the Clydesdale Bank 40, and was rewarded with a two-year contract extension."", 'During the winter off-seasons, he plied his trade for Mid West Rhinos in Zimbabwe and cracked the first double-hundred of his career for them in 2011-12. He passed 1000 first-class runs in only 14 innings during the season and captained Rhinos to the final of the 50-over Coca-Cola Cup competition.', 'As Yorkshire regained their Division One status at the first attempt in 2012, Ballance was again a key figure. His 613 Championship runs included an unbeaten 121 as Yorkshire completed the second-biggest successful run chase in their history against Gloucestershire at Bristol in May, when they knocked off a target of 400 in 110 overs; Ballance clinched victory with a four followed by consecutive sixes. ', ""Such performances led to his selection for the England Lions squad for a limited-overs tour of Australia in February 2013, where Ballance made three half-centuries despite the team losing every game. Centuries for the Lions against Australia and Bangladesh A during the 2013 season pressed his case further and led to an ODI debut against Ireland. He made a two-ball duck but 1251 Championship runs, including five hundreds, were enough to win him a place in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia."", 'Despite growing up on a tobacco farm in Harare, Ballance does have British roots through his grandparents, one of whom flew for the RAF during World War II.

Indeed, the day after he was chosen for England's 2017-18 Ashes tour party, he went for 94 in an ODI against West Indies in Southampton (England's third most expensive analysis at the time), only for England to ease his pain by waltzing to a 289 target with nine wickets and 12 overs to spare."", 'The nephew of Bruce French, the former Nottinghamshire and England wicket-keeper, Ball is a former England Under-19 international.

Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed. \n"", ""Bairstow's wicketkeeping has rarely met with universal approval and, much to his chagrin, the debate as occasional chances have been spurned about whether he might be better playing as a specialist batsman has never been silenced. But from the moment that he delivered an emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, where his father has strong off-season links, and the aggressive batting that Yorkshire prized so highly has become a regular feature of the England scene, with only regular appearances in T20 eluding him."", ""He has had to fight against a tendency to play across the line and, to that end, he stands tall, bat held aloft, adding to his pugnacious image. Driven and independently minded, he is very much his own man. Intensive work with Bruce French, England's wicketkeeping coach, has also made his keeping more secure."", ""He was a talented all-round sportsman at an early age, even having trials with Leeds United as a right back. But it was cricket which soon dominated. An early starter with Yorkshire's Under-15s, he was named Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year in 2007, having already played for Yorkshire's Second XI and their Academy side and represented England Under-17. In October 2008, he followed in his father's footsteps by signing a full-time contract with Yorkshire.  He was eight-years-old when his father took his own life. Merely to play the game, and for the same county was courageous enough."", ""He made an impressive first-class debut against Somerset in June 2009, cracking 82 in his second innings and soon secured his place in the first XI and further honours followed when he was picked up by England's Performance Programme and included in the England Lions successful tour of the Caribbean in January 2011."", ""By now Yorkshire's first-choice keeper, he registered his maiden first-class hundred against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May of that year. Having previously passed fifty 17 times in 34 first-class matches without reaching three figures, just to emphasise his breakthrough, he made it a double. During his brilliant attacking innings, he was joined by England's recently retired opening bowler Ryan Sidebottom, in a record ninth wicket partnership for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire (which had stood since 1899) of 151. Bairstow and Sidebottom were sons of two of Yorkshire's best-loved former players, David Bairstow and Arnie Sidebottom. The passing of talent between the generations could not have been more satisfactorily captured."", 'Many suspected that, long term, Bairstow would become a specialist batsman and his debut innings in one-day internationals backed up that theory as he hit an unbeaten 41 off 21 balls against India at Cardiff before a tough tour of India showed the realities of international cricket. However, further development followed with a match-winning T20 innings against Pakistan in the UAE and after a strong start to the 2012 season he was handed a call-up to the Test squad to face West Indies.', ""It was not a happy series for Bairstow, whose problems against some hostile short bowling from Kemar Roach gained much media attention, and after a modest return of 38 runs at 12.66 he was left out of the opening Test of the South Africa series as England went with Ravi Bopara. Confirmation that he had slipped back in the selectors' thinking came when Bopara withdrew from the second Test for personal reasons and James Taylor was preferred."", ""But after Kevin Pietersen was dropped in extraordinary circumstances for the third Test at Lord's, another opportunity arose for Bairstow to which he responded magnificently. Confidence bolstered by a century for England Lions against Australia A, he led an England fightback from 54 for 4 in their first innings on day two with a brilliant 95, emerging from a peppering with short deliveries to play some fluent attacking shots in an innings former England captain Michael Vaughan said would have been the finest maiden Test century he had witnessed had his fellow Yorkshireman not been bowled by Morne Morkel."", 'His increasing international involvement restricted his appearances for Yorkshire, although he did find time to hit 182 - his second biggest first-class score - to set up a crushing win over Leicestershire at Scarborough in the Championship and a match-winning 68 not out against Sussex in the semi-finals of the FLt20.', ""Bairstow retained his place for England's winter schedule, beginning with the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka. He was unable to make a significant contribution and his participation in the India Test series was also limited before he was granted leave to return home because of a family illness, missing the subsequent ODI series."", ""Thereafter his bit-part status congealed - he lost his spot in the T20 team following the New Zealand tour and, after returning to the Test team during the Ashes as England dropped Nick Compton and moved Joe Root up the order, he was abruptly left out at The Oval. He spent much of the summer running 12th man errands at a crucial stage in his development. A squad member for the return tour of Australia, he played in the last two Tests, replacing the out-of-form Matt Prior, but did not unearth the performances to promote his worth as Prior's long-term successor and had to buckle down to the county circuit the following summer."", ""That 2015 season promised to be the making of him as he struck 1108 first-class runs at 92.33, allowed by Yorkshire to play as he saw fit. Nothing was more emphatic than his 366-run alliance with Tim Bresnan at Chester-le-Street, both players making carer-bests, Yorkshire's fifth highest stand of all time. England were receptive. A combative 83 not out at Chester-le-Street after a late summons settled a weather-hit ODI against New Zealand in England's favour and the faltering form of Buttler brought a Test recall against Australia."", ""It was Cape Town, though, where Bairstow really broke through, as the summer of 2016 testified. Bairstow's second Test ton was reserved for his home crowd against Sri Lanka: 140, batting at No. 7, out of 298. On a challenging surface, he played with a certainty not given to others. England's top order was repeatedly found wanting in Test cricket, but the belligerence of Bairstow and co down the order constantly dug them out of a hole, and another hundred at Lord's followed."", 'His desire was relentless and his growing impact in ODIs was enough for him to replace the out-of-form Jason Roy at the top of the order in the Champions Trophy semi-final - a defeat against Pakistan in Cardiff. The West Indies felt his frustration at that at the end of the summer in the form of his first two ODI hundreds.\n', '\n', '\n']","['Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year 2007', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year 2011"", 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2009, 2011']",63.0,109,6,3806,167*,36.95,6839,55.65,6,20,447,24,160.0,11.0,59.0,54,8,2118,141*,46.04,2017,105,6,8,232,46,24.0,2.0,30.0,25,6,513,68,27,394,130.2,0,3,48,19,28.0,0.0,174.0,285,32,11352,246,44.86,,,24,61,,,446.0,22.0,127.0,116,14,4040,174,39.6,3901,103.56,9,18,390,105,75.0,8.0,99.0,87,17,1766,102*,25.22,1383,127.69,1,7,131,68,61.0,10.0,63.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,59.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,30.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,174.0,1,6,1,0,-,-,-,1,-,0,0,0,127.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,99.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

6 ft 2 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Right-arm slow,,,,"['\nIf there was any doubt about the place Alastair Cook held in the affections of England cricket supporters, they were dispelled during his final Test. \n', ""Cook was never an especially elegant batsman. He wasn't especially eloquent, either. And his career encompassed its fair share of downs as well as ups. There were moments - such as in the latter stages of his time captaining England's ODI side or during the interminable fall-out of the Kevin Pietersen saga - when it seemed his love affair with his side's supporters could sour. "", 'In the end, though, his determination, his longevity, his decency and, yes, his sheer number of runs, shone through. And as The Oval crowd stood to give him ovation after ovation - the one that greeted his second-innings century lasted several minutes and held up play - the respect and popularity for him was abundantly clear. A knighthood - the first for an England cricketer since Sir Ian Botham in 2007 - followed a few months later. He continued to represent Essex.', ""In truth, Cook had been in decline as a batsman for some time. While still young - he was 33 when he played his final Test - there were many miles on the clock. He had already become his nation's highest run-scorer and century maker in Test cricket, he had also taken the most catches (as a non-keeper) and set a world record for the most Test caps in succession: an eye-watering 159."", 'Perhaps more pertinently, he appeared to never fully recover his spark after the Pietersen affair and the disappointment of losing the ODI captaincy on the eve of the 2015 World Cup. He had, he admitted, lost a ""bit of edge"" in the months before his retirement. While the occasional vast score - he made a double-century in his penultimate Ashes Test at Melbourne in 2017-18 - partially masked the decline, he reached 50 only twice in the 15 Tests before that Oval farewell. ', ""His career had, by then, encompassed some outrageous highs. The Ashes of 2010-11, for example, saw him amass 766 runs in seven innings to anchor England's first series win in Australia for 24 years. In so doing, he went past 5,000 Test runs, having turned 26 on Christmas Day - the second youngest batsman to reach the landmark after Sachin Tendulkar - and won the ICC's Test batsman of the year. Two years later and further records had been broken as he became England's leading Test century-maker - hitting No. 23 against India in Kolkata, his third in three matches - and the youngest player to pass 7,000 runs."", ""His finest captaincy moment may well have come near the start of his reign. The series victory in India in 2012-13 - England's first for 28 years - was testament not just to his outstanding batting, but also his willingness, at that point, to reintegrate Pietersen to the team despite considerable opposition. Two modest Australian teams were defeated in favourable English conditions in 2013 and 2015 - victory did not always silence grumbles about England's safety-first, regimented approach - and, in his final year in the job, South Africa fell too."", 'But there were significant disappointments, too. He led the side that was whitewashed in the 2013-14 Ashes and which subsequently descended into a power struggle over Pietersen. The coach, Andy Flower, resigned, Pietersen was banished, but Cook (who had been party to the decision over Pietersen) stayed on, only to be beaten by Sri Lanka in England the following summer when he almost resigned, such was the ferocity of the criticism on social media. Heartfelt applause at the Ageas Bowl for his painstaking 95 against India to end a desperately lean run was something he treasured.', ""His stubbornness was sometimes to his detriment. The apparently unquenchable self-belief, that helped turn a relatively limited player into England's record Test run-scorer, also convinced him that he was the man to revive England's ODI fortunes. As a result he lingered too long as captain of an outmoded side and was stung by the consequent criticism. While he led the team within an ace of that elusive global ODI title (the Champions Trophy of 2013), he was omitted from the 2015 World Cup squad, ending his limited-overs career around his 30th birthday. The change came too late to spare England a humiliating failure, but their improvement in the format thereafter was telling."", 'Cook\'s leadership was, in many ways, like his batting: unyielding, determined and deliberate, but lacking the spark of tactical genius. But his rock-like commitment to the cause, and high personal standards, were cause for considerable respect and gratitude. When he resigned as Test captain in the aftermath of a 4-0 trouncing by India in 2016, he was still only 32. His team, Pietersen apart, gave him great loyalty. Andrew Strauss, his predecessor as England captain and by then England\'s managing director, generously said he ""deserves to be looked upon as one of England\'s great captains.""', 'Twelve of his hundreds came as England captain (10 after he had won the job on a permanent basis), although he made only five in his last 48 Tests in charge, more symptomatic perhaps of the burdens he had to withstand rather than worsening technical deficiencies. His 24 Test wins in 59 Tests made him the joint second-most successful captain for England in terms of Test wins, behind Michael Vaughan, who had 26. His 22 defeats were also a record.', 'Those in the know were saying that the young Cook was destined for great things from early on. Cook was thrown in at the deep end by Essex the year after he left Bedford School with a fistful of batting records. He captained England in the Under-19 World Cup early in 2004, scored his maiden first-class hundred later that year, and added a double-century for Essex against the Australian tourists in 2005.', 'The following spring he was called up by the full England side when injuries struck in India. He had been in the Caribbean with the A team when the SOS came but, unfazed, stroked 60 and a magnificent century to complete a memorable debut in Nagpur. His ability to play long, attritional innings without showing signs of fatigue - it became a cliché that he did not sweat - was evident from the outset.', ""Bowlers began to exploit that penchant for hanging on the front foot, but Cook still made his share of runs. By the time of his 25th birthday on Christmas Day 2009 he had scored far more runs (3,536 to David Gower's 2,548) and centuries (nine to Ian Botham's six) than any other Englishman of a comparable age. He hit three more Test hundreds in 2009 - but none of them were in the Ashes series, in which 95 at Lord's was his only score above 32 as the Aussies probed that front-pad problem."", ""The Pakistan attack of 2010 caused ever more problems and probably took him as close to being dropped as at any time. But a century at The Oval, a gritty, gutsy innings, ensured he would open in the Ashes series in which he proved so decisive. It's probably a fair microcosm of his career: he never claimed to be the most talented, but somehow he found a way. And in taking on the fast bowlers and the new ball for a decade and more, without shrinking or shirking, he earned the respect in which he came to be held."", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006', 'Young Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in June 2011', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2012', 'Knighted in 2018']",161.0,291,16,12472,294,45.35,26562,46.95,33,57,1442,11,175.0,0.0,92.0,92,4,3204,137,36.4,4154,77.13,5,19,363,10,36.0,0.0,4.0,4,0,61,26,15.25,54,112.96,0,0,10,0,1.0,0.0,289.0,513,36,22604,294,47.38,44429,50.87,63,107,,,306.0,0.0,160.0,158,11,5851,137,39.8,7332,79.8,12,34,,,66.0,0.0,32.0,30,2,892,100*,31.85,699,127.61,1,5,95,15,13.0,0.0,161.0,2,18,7,1,01-Jun,01-Jun,7,2.33,18,0,0,0,92.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,4.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,289.0,,282,211,7,Mar-13,,30.14,4.48,40.2,0,0,0,160.0,,18,10,0,-,-,-,3.33,-,0,0,0,32.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

5 ft 11 in ",,Allrounder,Right-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nPaul Collingwood was never the most gifted cricketer to play for England, but there was so much to admire for all that. That he was a cricketer of substance was undeniable. As his county career came to an end in 2018, at the age of 42, he symbolised how much could be achieved by pluck, good sense and a deal of athleticism.  \n', 'A natural athlete with a happy-go-lucky temperament, Collingwood became the first England captain to ever deliver a global tournament when England beat Australia to win the 2010 World Twenty20. It was reward for nine years of uncomplaining professionalism, in which time he fought his way through a melee of seemingly more talented opponents to make himself indispensable in all forms of the game.', ""It took a long time to prise out Collingwood from the middle. More than seven years after the end of his England career, he retired with quite a record: he represented Durham in 23 of their 26 years in professional cricket and amassed 304 first-class appearances, 16,844 runs and 164 wickets.\nIn common with Marcus Trescothick at Somerset, he grew into one of the grand old stagers of the county circuit, communicating that England's professional circuit remained a place where international stars who had known the best could still find satisfaction. A phlegmatic, hard-working, get-the-job-done cricketer, he squeezed value from himself to the very last drop.\nHe called time on his England Test career at the end of the 2010-11 Ashes series, finishing on a high by becoming a three-times Ashes winner, and by the time he ended his ODI career two months later, he was England's leading ODI run scorer and most capped player. But his contribution was far from spent: he went on to lead Durham to the Championship in 2013 and his growing reputation as one of England's old sages was amplified when he accepted a part-time coaching role with Scotland and guided them to the World Cup finals. An opportunity working as England's fielding coach under Ashley Giles began his gradual shift in the later stages of his career from player to coach."", ""Collingwood's greatest asset was his ability to contribute to the team in several aspects. As a batsman, he stands still at the crease, plays the ball straight and has a tantalising range of strokes up his sleeve. His bowling verged towards the dibbly-dobbly, but given the right conditions he could be irresistible, as he proved with a matchwinning display of swing bowling in the third one-day game against New Zealand in 2001-02. As a fielder, he was one of the finest in the world, capable of breathtaking moments in the covers and backward point. The final tick in his column was his determination, which made him go to Melbourne in the winter of 2000-01 to play grade cricket when he realised he was treading water."", ""For the first few years in his international career he seemed destined to be a fill-in player. But at Lahore in the winter of 2005, he stuck 96 and 80 before hitting a brilliant maiden century at Nagpur with England in the middle of an injury crisis. He kicked on to become the rock of England's batting on the subsequent Ashes tour. His brilliant double-century at Adelaide ought to have been the defining moment of his career. Instead it was the preamble to one of the most devastating defeats in English Test history. But after an understandable period of introspection, Collingwood bounced back with consecutive one-day centuries to secure the CB Series. It was England's first overseas one-day trophy for nine years, and his subsequent appointment to the captaincy in June 2007 was met with unanimous approval. He cemented the role with memorable victories over India at home and Sri Lanka away."", ""A slump in form in 2008 led to his omission from the Test team and his resignation as ODI captain, but he took back the reins for the World Twenty20 in 2009, a decision that didn't look too prudent when England were embarrassed by the Netherlands in the opening match of the tournament. But less than a year later England had developed into a ruthless power-packed Twenty20 side. Led by Collingwood, their blend of fearless hitting with dynamite fielding and thoughtful bowling brushed aside all challenges as England won the tournament. They got there in style - beating Australia in the final - with Collingwood finishing the job with the winning runs."", ""A difficult summer followed, where Collingwood struggled to come to terms with the seam and swing of Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. His batting form failed to improve during England's historic Ashes success the winter after but his fielding remained exemplary - setting the benchmark for England's high standards. In the final Ashes Test in Sydney he dismissed Michael Hussey in the first innings, sparking wild celebrations. And with England on the verge of a 3-1 triumph, he chose to retire from Test cricket, calling time on a successful Test career which many thought would never happen. He had hoped to keep playing limited-overs cricket for England but a poor World Cup followed the Ashes and he was subsequently dropped from both England's teams and replaced as Twenty20 captain by Stuart Broad."", 'After considering retirement from all cricket, he decided to continue with Durham and succeeded Phil Mustard as captain in 2012, winning an impressive seven of his first 10 matches at the helm as steering Durham from bottom of the table to safety. A Championship title duly followed in 2013 as he reinvigorated Durham in a manner few seriously expected. When some bad investments made life harder in 2014 he still led Durham to the Royal London One-Day Cup and picked up the Player of the Year award for good measure. He had become a wonderful ambassador for county cricket, but Durham were stricken by financial problems and when the ECB was forced to bail them out, as a last resort, at the end of 2016 they did so with stringent penalties - relegation from Division One of the Championship included - intended to give a warning message to others. Collingwood termed it ""a kick in the nuts"", but Durham could also learn from his ability to squeeze maximum benefit from the toughest situations.', ""That relegation brought a rush of departures, but while Collingwood was still standing there was still hope. He made 1,000 Championship runs in 2017 and became the oldest player to make a T20 hundred and Durham's first century-maker in that format, against Worcestershire at New Road.  Aged 41 years & 65 days, Collingwood beat ex-Worcestershire player Graeme Hick (41y 37d) who struck 110 against Northamptonshire in 2007. A rush of Durham awards followed. A season later, with the county showing signs of recovery, he felt able to call time."", '\n']",['Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005'],68.0,115,10,4259,206,40.56,9170,46.44,10,20,470,24,96.0,0.0,197.0,181,37,5092,120*,35.36,6614,76.98,5,26,365,74,108.0,0.0,36.0,33,2,583,79,18.8,459,127.01,0,3,37,24,15.0,0.0,306.0,527,52,16938,206,35.65,,,35,85,,,352.0,0.0,428.0,401,73,11240,132,34.26,,,10,65,,,207.0,0.0,148.0,131,16,2478,108*,21.54,2040,121.47,1,9,167,86,49.0,0.0,68.0,59,1905,1018,17,Mar-23,Mar-35,59.88,3.2,112,0,0,0,197.0,151,5186,4294,111,Jun-31,Jun-31,38.68,4.96,46.7,3,1,0,36.0,20,234,347,16,Apr-22,Apr-22,21.68,8.89,14.6,1,0,0,306.0,,12706,6396,166,May-52,,38.53,3.02,76.5,,2,0,428.0,,11482,9228,273,Jun-31,Jun-31,33.8,4.82,42,5,1,0,148.0,108,1852,2245,99,05-Jun,05-Jun,22.67,7.27,18.7,4,2,0

An England career, amounting to six Tests, and a decade at Hampshire, his third county, had identified him as a left-handed opener of panache, particularly suited to the demands of T20, and a fielder of great athleticism. \n', ""Carberry revitalised his international career following a blood clot on the lung in 2010. Such was the threat to his professional career that just to make a full recovery was cause for celebration. But that did not prevent a certain disillusionment creeping in when he was one of the chief players to suffer from England's 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia in 2013-14. It was an aggrieved Carberry who returned to Hampshire with his international career seemingly spent, even the absence of convincing replacements for the role of Alastair Cook's opening partner not persuading the selectors to take another look. An occasional inexplicable error with the bat and in the field did not advance his case."", ""He began in county cricket at Kent, and then Surrey but became frustrated with a lack of opportunity and moved to Hampshire in 2006. The move did the trick and he made over 1000 first-class runs in a season for first time in 2007, a performance that earned him a call-up to the England Lions tour of India in early 2008 where he scored two hundreds and was also one of three centurions in the Lions' game against New Zealand in May 2008. "", 'His reputation in domestic cricket continued to grow, and he scored 1251 runs at 69.50 in 12 County Championship in the 2009 season, with four hundreds - the highlight being a fluent 204 against Warwickshire at the Rose Bowl - until a broken finger ruled him out of the end of the campaign. But it was enough to earn a Test call up and he made his debut in Chittagong in March 2010 in place of the rested Andrew Strauss', 'His lung illness ruled him out of the England Performance Programme trip to Australia over the winter of 2010-11 just as he gained a foothold in the England side.  It was a long road back. Carberry missed the first three months of the 2011 season but then returned to the Hampshire side with startling effect: he scored an unbeaten 300 during a Championship match against Yorkshire and shared in a third-wicket partnership of 523 with Neil McKenzie - a partnership record at the time for Hampshire. ', ""Following his illness he was unable to take long-haul flights but he remained on England's radar with the selectors naming him in their Lions side to face the touring West Indies in May 2012. "", ""In 2013, Carberry enjoyed a strong summer in one-day cricket with over 500 runs in the T20 competition, including a century in the quarter-final win over Lancashire. He was picked for England's ODI in Ireland and retained for the Australia series. He made only one half-century but England picked him to tour Australia and Carberry made his Test comeback. He did not disgrace himself despite England's whitewash but the selectors decide to enter a new era without him and Carberry's international career was effectively ended."", 'After leaving Australia, he played just once more for his country - in an ODI against Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street the following May. If it was his final appearance in England colours it was an inglorious one - he scored six as England were skittled for 99.', ""His presence at the top of Hampshire's order remained as strong as ever, though. Even in 2015 when he did not make a first-class century, his consistency put him among the top runmakers in Division One and helped to bind Hampshire's spirit in a season where they escaped relegation on the final day. A dangerous T20 player, he was a vital component in a highly-successful Hampshire side and also played in the Big Bash for Perth Scorchers."", 'He moved to Leicestershire late in the 2017 season, enticed by a promise of the captaincy which he duly inherited in 2018. But the incoming coach, Paul Nixon, relieved him of the role in late May after a review, describing him as ""slightly more reactive than proactive"" and ""a man of great integrity"" replacing him with Paul Horton. Carberry took paid leave to consider his future as Leicestershire made it clear they wanted him to return as a player and later that season he indicated that he was considering legal action, his time at Leicestershire - and perhaps his entire county career - seemingly at an end.

6 ft 2 in ",,Bowler,Right-hand bat,Right-arm fast-medium,,,,"[""\nJade Dernbach is a very modern cricketer. Earrings in both ears, tattoos covering each arm and words to accompany each delivery. His bowling is a merry-go-round of variations with slower-balls, quicker slower-balls, yorkers and bouncers as well as, crucially, an ability to touch 90mph. His variety, alongside a deep well of confidence that helps him hold his nerve, often at the most demanding times, made him a regular part of England's limited-overs teams for three years, although his penchant for over-exuberant celebrations - he has been known to run the length of the ground after getting wickets in dead first-class matches - have been widely mocked.  \n"", ""That mocking was a cross he had to bear - an extravagant appearance meant he did not blend into the background easily - but when his England career stalled - he was last seen at World Twenty20 in Chittagong in 2014 when he ran into AB de Villiers, a man on a mission - he contributed to Surrey's re-emergence as one of England's strongest counties with great passion and was a ready source of encouragement and advice for the next generation. He has been a more thoughtful cricketer than many have imagined."", ""His accent reflected a journeyed background. Born in South Africa but a graduate of the Surrey Academy, Dernbach became Surrey's youngest debutant for 30 years when - at the age of 17 - he played against India A in 2003. In 2005 he was thrust into the spotlight when selected to play against Lancashire in the semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup, although with figures of 0 for 52, he was clearly under-prepared. His first-team chances were limited thereafter, although he showed some potential in the 2nd XI."", ""A spell in Australia, playing grade cricket in Sydney for Randwick/Petersham, helped to improve his all-round game and his first hint of international recognition came in 2009 when he was called up to the ECB Fast Bowling Programme in Florida and Chennai. He was part of the Performance squad during the Ashes winter in 2010-11, and was playing in the Caribbean for England Lions when he heard of his call-up to the World Cup squad, as a replacement for Ajmal Shahzad. Though he didn't play in England's disappointing campaign he made his T20 and ODI debuts the following summer and established himself as an important part of the side."", 'However, even after than 50 international appearances, he was still fighting for full acceptance. Impressive performances have been grossly outweighed, in terms of publicity, by his mishaps. He had the ignominy of possessing some of the worst economy rates of all time in ODIs and T20 internationals and a desperate showing at the World T20 looked to have halted his England career in its tracks. By the end of 2014, he was not even an automatic selection for Surrey in Championship cricket, and was embarrassed to concede 56 in four overs of the T20 Blast semi-final. He reportedly considered leaving Surrey after his initial contractual demands were rejected, but ultimately opted to remain at the club. ', ""He not only stayed, he gained deepening respect. In 2015, he became only the third man to take a hat-trick in a Lord's final, although his 6 for 35 against Gloucestershire came in defeat, and had to endure three successive defeats in all as Surrey became perennial bridesmaids in the Lord's showcase final. Statistics insisted that in county cricket he deserved to be recognised as one of the finest List A performers of his time."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2004, 2009']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.0,8,1,19,5,2.71,39,48.71,0,0,1,0,5.0,0.0,34.0,7,2,24,12,4.8,21,114.28,0,0,3,0,8.0,0.0,113.0,139,47,871,56*,9.46,,,0,1,,,17.0,0.0,144.0,51,19,242,31,7.56,293,82.59,0,0,,,31,0,145.0,33,15,143,24*,7.94,131,109.16,0,0,15,3,34.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24.0,24,1234,1308,31,Apr-45,Apr-45,42.19,6.35,39.8,1,0,0,34.0,33,702,1020,39,Apr-22,Apr-22,26.15,8.71,18,1,0,0,113.0,,18222,10139,311,Jun-47,,32.6,3.33,58.5,11,10,0,144.0,,6283,6181,228,Jun-35,Jun-35,27.1,5.9,27.5,10,3,0,145.0,142,2935,4149,158,Apr-22,Apr-22,26.25,8.48,18.5,2,0,0

Beyond his 30th birthday, his county career seemed to be slowly and respectably fading away. But that England call, legitimised by his peers as he won the PCA Players\' Player of the Year award as well as topping the Most Valuable Player rankings, marked a wonderful renaissance.  \n', ""Denly finished in the top two in Kent's batting order in all three formats and stood in as captain for much of the season for Sam Billings in his absences on IPL or England duty, helping Kent to a Royal London Cup final and, unexpectedly, promotion to Division One of the Championship after 11 seasons. "", ""In two seasons, he had scored 14 centuries across the three formats, including nine in first-class cricket. The leg spin that removed South Africa's Graeme Smith with his first ball in international cricket - his only England wicket at the time of his recall - had matured, too: 57 wickets in the three competitions in 2018, a part-timer no longer. The anecdote that his former Kent captain, Rob Key, would never bowl him because he thought he was just a bored batsman in the field, was gleefully told all summer."", ""Denly looked well placed to establish himself in England's ODI and T20 teams after deservedly earning an international call-up in 2009 - and many thought he might also break into the Test line-up. For eight years, those ambitions seemed lost, a move from Kent to Middlesex failing to reignite his career, and in 2015 he returned to the county of his birth with considerable success. Remarkably, considering that Canterbury has been the county headquarters since 1870, Denly was held by the county's website to be the first capped player to be born in the town. Many words could be spent analysing the message that carried. "", ""A product of the Kent youth system, having been with the county since the age of 13, Denly made his debut in 2004 against Oxford University. He served notice of his considerable talent with three half centuries in three Under-19s Tests whilst touring India with England in 2005. He captained both Kent 2nd XI and the ECB Development of Excellence XI team, and scored his maiden first-class hundred against Cambridge University in 2006. Then the release of David Fulton opened up a place in the Kent top order, which Denly took with both hands during the first part of the 2007 season. His prolific form caught the eye of England's selectors and he was named in the England Lions side to face India."", 'The 2008 summer again kept him in the frame, especially in one-day cricket, where he enjoyed an impressive T20 tournament. But it was in 2009, after averaging 51.85 in the Friends Provident Trophy, that Denly got his international call-up. He had his moments opening the batting, making half-centuries against Ireland and Australia and averaging 29.77 in nine ODIs. But he struggled for consistency, looking particularly vulnerable to the ball coming back into him, and, like many before him, then suffered a lengthy domestic slump after being dropped from the international side. ', ""At one stage he went nearly two years without a Championship hundred. Sensing a need to revive his career he left Kent at the end of 2011 and moved to Middlesex. But his form continued to be patchy, and in 2014 he regularly found himself left out of the side, as he averaged just 23.35 in the Championship. In three seasons at Lord's, Denly hit only two centuries in all formats of the game. After he was released, he opted to return to Kent to try and reinvigorate his career, hoping to rekindle a highly effective partnership with Key, preparing for the challenge by playing domestic cricket for Brother Union in Bangladesh. "", ""Denly's return to Kent was a satisfying one as he became one of only two Kent players to hit 1,000 Championship runs. That consistency was sadly lacking the following summer, although he did have a career-best 206 not out against Northants in May to sustain him and also won further attention in the following Championship game when he put family ahead of profession when he abandoned an innings against Derbyshire in Derby overnight to be at the birth of his first child."", ""With his 30th birthday behind him, Denly delivered the best season of his career in 2017, topping Kent's averages in both the Championship and Twenty20. His four Championship hundreds included  his 182 against Leicestershire as he and triple-centurion Sean Dickson set a new county record of 382, and also a career-best 227 on a sweltering day at Worcester. In T20, nobody made more runs than his 567. 2018 followed the same pattern. England's national selector Ed Smith could resist the selection no longer.\n"", '\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2004', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2005', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2006', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2007', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2008']",2.0,4.0,0.0,112.0,69,28,234.0,47.86,0.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,9,0,268,67,29.77,409,65.52,0,2,31,1,5.0,0.0,9.0,8,0,72,30,9,81,88.88,0,0,9,0,2.0,0.0,191.0,329,23,11098,227,36.26,19719,56.28,27,55,,,78.0,0.0,151.0,145,16,4668,150*,36.18,6091,76.63,8,23,,,52,0,202.0,195,16,5033,127,28.11,4123,122.07,4,30,532,140,80.0,0.0,2.0,2,24,17,0,-,-,-,4.25,-,0,0,0,9.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,9.0,4,60,70,7,Apr-19,Apr-19,10,7,8.5,1,0,0,191.0,,4286,2312,62,Apr-36,6/114,37.29,3.23,69.1,1,0,0,151.0,,1304,1098,46,Apr-35,Apr-35,23.86,5.05,28.3,3,0,0,202.0,33,475,622,31,Apr-19,Apr-19,20.06,7.85,15.3,1,0,0

His success was a triumph of willpower over several technical deficiencies including a dominant bottom hand and unorthodox leg and head positions which led him to lean back in the drive. \n"", ""Taking over from Alec Stewart in July 1999, Hussain established himself as the best and - not coincidentally - the most articulate England captain since Mike Brearley. Under Hussain, England won four Test series in a row for the first time since Brearley, and rose to third place in the ICC Test Championship table when it was launched, after being ninth and last in the prototype Wisden World Championship in September 1999. Hussain's style of captaincy was a reflection of his personality, never static, always full of energy and ideas."", ""He was known to make four field-changes in one over in a Test match, searching for the solution, trying to make up for the lack of variety among his attack of mostly right-arm seamers with his own imaginative placements. His batting while captain veered from one extreme to another, from the heights of England's tour to South Africa to a worse run than even Brearley knew."", ""Yet so widespread was the recognition of Hussain's merit as captain that his place was never questioned, unlike Brearley's. Nor were there many calls for his head despite consecutive Ashes drubbings in 2001 and 2002-03."", 'However, after a disappointing performance by England in the 2003 World Cup, Hussain relinquished the one-day international captaincy, and he resigned the Test captaincy during the series against South Afrcia later in the summer explaining that he had ""grown tired"" of the role.', ""He played on in the team in that series, and toured Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies that winter, playing a big part in helping England to their first win in the Caribbean for 36 years. However, the calls for his resignation increased, and he finally resigned from all forms of cricket in May 2004, three days after an unbeaten hundred against New Zealand at Lord's. He immediately joined Sky Sports' commentary team, and quickly became one of its more incisive members."", ""A firebrand in his youth, renowned for looking after number one in run-out situations, Hussain tempered his fire into a fierce commitment to England's cause - when his brittle fingers weren't broken, that is.

In Hampshire's T20 campaign of 2015 Dawson played two games, scored three runs in one knock and did not take a wicket; he scored three in his solitary T20 innings. With his career faltering, he was loaned out to Essex for a month. Then, on his return to Hampshire, came a remarkable transformation. \n"", ""Surrey's Zafar Ansari, who England most favoured as the next spin-bowling allrounder in line, suffered a serious hand injury and, with options scarce, Dawson was summoned to the England Performance Programme. Tough-minded and versatile, he did enough to join England's T20 World Cup squad in India, although he did not play; his England T20 debut came on his home ground at the Ageas Bowl against Sri Lanka in July 2016; an ODI debut against Pakistan also followed by the end of the summer; and the winter brought a Test debut in Chennai."", ""Dawson was initially overlooked as a spinning allrounder for England's Test tours of Bangladesh and India in 2016, with Ansari preferred, but Ansari was hampered by back trouble in India and Dawson joined the squad in mid-series. A Test debut followed in Chennai, where he made a dogged, unbeaten 66 batting at No. 8."", ""Dawson, first involved with Hampshire at 10 years old, responded with a solid county season, scoring more than 1,300 runs at 45 in all formats and taking 47 wickets with left-arm spin designed for the limited-overs format. He was chosen for England's Test squad in Bangladesh and, although he did not play, he won a contract with Rangpur Riders in the BPL."", ""Dawson is a former England U-19 captain who recorded the best figures for the side with 6 for 9 against Malaysia in 2007. He then steadily developed into a top order batsman with the supplementary quality of useful left-arm spin. He has grown into an integral part of Hampshire's side in all formats and is now arguably Hampshire's most versatile player, able to bat anywhere across the batting order as well as bowl in all forms of the game."", 'When both Shane Warne and Shaun Udal left Hampshire in 2007, Dawson gained his chance but it was as a batsmen he most impressed and, at 18, he scored a maiden first-class century at Trent Bridge in September 2008 - the youngest player to score a hundred for the county - and grew into an opening batsman, taking his chance when Michael Carberry was absent from the 2011 season, scoring two centuries. He escaped an unwanted record with the ball by the skin of his teeth, however when he was carted for five sixes in succession (and off the first five balls of an over; the final one cost only a single) by a young Ben Stokes in a Championship game against Durham.', 'He continued to work on his bowling overseas, taking 7 for 51 on debut for Mountaineers in Zimbabwe before the 2012 season and that summer hit the headlines by dismissing Kevin Pietersen for two golden ducks in a 40-over and T20 match. He found himself a role opening the bowling in T20, taking nine wickets at 24.22 as Hampshire won the T20 competition and a year later, 13 at 21.30 as they reached finals day for the fourth consecutive year. ', ""Dawson put up over 1000 first-class runs for the first time in 2013. But a year later he regressed, disappointing in 10 matches of Hampshire's promotion-winning season and playing little part in T20 cricket. Something was needed to spark up his career and his loan spell at Essex did just that. "", ""After an excellent 50-over campaign with bat and ball, he ousted fellow slow left-armer Danny Briggs from the Championship side, finding himself the county's senior spinner when Briggs moved to Sussex in search of regular cricket across all formats. "", ""2016 was a memorable one with England debts in T20 and 50-over formats. He was overlooked as a spinning allrounder for England's Test tours of Bangladesh and India in 2016, with Ansari preferred, but Ansari was hampered by back trouble in India and Dawson joined the squad in mid-series. His unbeaten 66 in Chennai was the highest Test score by an England debutant batting at No. 8, an obscure but satisfying statistic."", ""Lord's against South Africa was his next call - only the second time England have fielded two specialist spinners on the ground for 30 years: he took four wickets, made a pair and gained an unwanted reputation among the media as a strikingly dull interviewee. But England's coach Trevor Bayliss and captain Joe Root regarded him as a tough and versatile competitor and he won another cap before the series was through."", ""Caps in limited-overs formats also built up sporadically and that Dawson, at 28, was beginning to regard himself as a one-day specialist was exemplified by his request to be excused an England Lions tour so he could play in an overseas T20 tournament. England were more forgiving of such things that they once were and his excellent T20 form for Hampshire in 2018 (by contrast he found himself batting at No 8 in the Championship) won him a place on England's one-day tour to Sri Lanka."", '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2007', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2008']",3.0,6.0,2.0,84.0,66*,21,197.0,42.63,0.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2,0,14,10,7,17,82.35,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2,1,17,10,17,8,212.5,0,0,2,1,2.0,0.0,142.0,233,25,6677,169,32.1,13736,48.6,8,35,801,24,138.0,0.0,151.0,123,22,3255,113*,32.22,3435,94.75,2,17,237,56,67,0,152.0,111,26,1633,82,19.21,1417,115.24,0,5,108,43,68.0,0.0,3.0,5,526,298,7,Feb-34,4/101,42.57,3.39,75.1,0,0,0,3.0,2,84,96,3,Feb-70,Feb-70,32,6.85,28,0,0,0,6.0,6,120,152,5,Mar-27,Mar-27,30.4,7.6,24,0,0,0,142.0,168,13095,6632,189,Jul-51,8/129,35.08,3.03,69.2,7,3,0,151.0,132,5672,4524,144,Jun-47,Jun-47,31.41,4.78,39.3,7,1,0,152.0,128,2390,2917,110,May-17,May-17,26.51,7.32,21.7,2,1,0

He made a surprise international debut in a Twenty20 against West Indies in Trinidad in 2009 but was soon replaced by Craig Kieswetter as England went on to lift the World Twenty20 in 2010. \n', ""Davies then replaced Kieswetter in the 50-over side and travelled to Australia in 2010-11 as England's first-choice wicketkeeper in limited-overs cricket and back-up to Matt Prior in the Test squad. Just one game into the seven-match ODI that series that preceded the World Cup, Davies was unexpectedly dumped from the team and replaced by Prior who went on to the World Cup without much success."", 'Davies had long been earmarked as a player with England potential. It was clear he had talent when he finished above Graeme Hick in the Worcestershire averages in his debut season in 2005, and he was selected for the National Academy and toured the West Indies with England A that winter. A former England Under-19 captain, Davies has impressed everyone who has come across him and, vitally, his glovework is an excellent standard. At the end of the 2009 season, sensing a need to challenge himself, Davies moved from Worcestershire to Surrey where he has been given the responsibility of batting in the top order.', 'A stylish left-handed batsman, he is particularly fluent through the offside but his tendency to hit the ball in the air has prevented him from nailing down an international position.', 'In February 2011 Davies became the first international cricketer to announce that he was gay, choosing to reveal the fact in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. He had come out to his family five years earlier and was also already out to his teammates.', 'The following year, Davies was badly affected by the death of his teammate and friend Tom Maynard, even considering his future in the game. He responded emphatically in 2013, though his stylish runs could not prevent Surrey from being relegated. At the start of 2014, he was regarded by many as a viable candidate for the Test gloves. To the surprise of many, including Surrey, he gave up the gloves early in the season, requesting to be picked as a specialist batsman instead. While he was certainly a good enough batsman to justify that - his first-class average hovered around 40 at the time - the decision effectively consigned his England career to the past.

But he failed to make the cut for the 2015 World Cup and, after Moores was sacked after a disastrous tournament, Gurney's England chances receded and his priorities again rested with Nottinghamshire where Moores was soon to renew coaching links with him. \n"", ""\nGurney played club cricket for Loughborough Town before graduating through Leicestershire's age group system. He missed most of 2007 with an ankle injury but made his first-class debut towards the end of the season and picked up a couple of wickets against Northamptonshire. In early 2008, while playing for Leeds-Bradford University, he showed his promise by removing Michael Vaughan and Jacques Rudolph."", ""His county career briefly hit problems in 2009 when after winning three summer contracts while studying economics at Leeds University, he was released by Leicestershire and invited to prove himself worthy of a contract the following April, something he initially refused before buckling down to win favour.  He remained something of a short-format specialist and was Leicestershire's leading wicket-taker in the 2011 Friends Life t20 with 23 scalps, but he missed Leicestershire's Finals Day victory with a side strain."", 'His development as a four-day player made big strides after he joined Nottinghamshire at the end of the 2011 season - joining the likes of James Taylor and Stuart Broad in the move across the East Midlands in search of greater recognition. Gurney went on to take 21 wickets in 10 Championship appearances for his new county compared with three from only one opportunity for Leicestershire in 2011. When he doubled the tally in 2013, his reputation as a solid county performer had been established.', ""Gurney's reputation began to blossom in 2013 when he finished the Championship season as Nottinghamshire's leading wicket-taker, taking 44 wickets at 30, enough to catch the eye of the England management who invited him to pre-Ashes nets along with another left-arm quick, Tymal Mills, to prepare England (unsuccessfully as it turned out) for an expected onslaught from Mitchell Johnson. "", ""Gurney's success in white-ball cricket had also captured the attention. More good news followed when he was picked in the England squad for a limited-overs tour of West Indies and named as a travelling reserve for the ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. He had a habit of taking top-order wickets and was adept bowling yorkers at the death. Add England's constant craving for left-arm quick bowlers and he had much to commend him. "", 'That won him 10 ODIs and two T20s in 2014 as England took a long look at him. After making an ODI debut against Scotland in Aberdeen, he acquitted himself ably in five ODIs against Sri Lanka - his best return coming with four wickets at Lord\'s - but only made one further appearance against India in the one-day series at the end of the season. Selection followed for an ODI series in Sri Lanka the same year - his first overseas tour. ""I want to go to the World Cup and win it,"" he pronounced, but he missed out to his county team-mate Stuart Broad, back from injury, and with Eoin Morgan assuming the captaincy and Moores replaced as coach, his international career looked over.', ""Gurney's stock as a bowler remained high, and there was time, too, for a personal tour de force with the bat. Gurney was a poster boy for No 11 batsmen, but his career-best display as the 2017 season died away could not have come at a more crucial time. Notts were in danger of following-on against Sussex at Hove on the third day, and defeat would have cost them promotion, but Gurney's 42 not out in a last-wicket stand of 73 with Matt Carter followed up a farewell century by Chris Read and helped to plot a remarkable escape."", '\n', '\n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,6,4,15,6*,7.5,33,45.45,0,0,1,0,1.0,0.0,2.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,0.0,103.0,131,63,424,42*,6.23,1045,40.57,0,0,53,6,12.0,0.0,92.0,28,17,60,13*,5.45,121,49.58,0,0,3,2,7,0,124.0,18,12,20,6,3.33,24,83.33,0,0,2,0,16.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,10,455,432,11,Apr-55,Apr-55,39.27,5.69,41.3,1,0,0,2.0,2,48,55,3,Feb-26,Feb-26,18.33,6.87,16,0,0,0,103.0,175,16909,9472,310,Jun-25,9/136,30.55,3.36,54.5,13,8,0,92.0,90,3874,3784,113,May-24,May-24,33.48,5.86,34.2,4,3,0,124.0,120,2585,3325,145,Apr-17,Apr-17,22.93,7.71,17.8,2,0,0

He was always a big man - 6ft 4ins and anywhere from 15-17 stone, depending on the recent calorie count - and the strain of juggernauting in and bowling at 90mph was inevitably a strain: his knees and ankles took multiple poundings from pitches and surgeons\' scalpels.', ""He was always a correct, powerful batsman, sometimes hesitant against quality spin. His bowling was always wholehearted and occasionally magnificent, when he was probing away outside off with a hint of reverse swing at high pace. But it wasn't until the New Zealand tour early in 2002 that Flintoff finally scored a Test century or took more than four wickets in a match. He looked established at last - but then another injury kept him out of the 2002-03 Ashes, although he was fit enough for the World Cup that followed in South Africa, where he was the most economical bowler on view."", ""That kicked off Flintoff's golden period - three home seasons when he was at his princely peak. First there was 2003, when a six off Makhaya Ntini was still rising as it thudded into the Bedser Stand at The Oval. In 2004 he finally slipped the handbrake and bowled at his fastest - and also smacked a rollicking Test-best 167 against West Indies at Edgbaston, when one of his seven sixes was memorably dropped by his father in the stands. And then there was the crowning glory of 2005, when he bestrode the Ashes series and was undoubtedly the leading cricketer in the world, a fact acknowledged by Wisden. The photograph of him consoling Brett Lee after England narrowly beat Australia at Edgbaston became the photograph to capture one of the great Test series."", 'After that, his body started rebelling. To make matters worse he was subsequently horribly miscast as captain in Australia in 2006-07, sometimes looking forlorn as his team sunk to a 5-0 whitewash. Worse came when an embarrassing tumble from a pedalo in the Caribbean after a late-night drinking session, which was plastered all over the newspapers, was the lowest point of in an abortive World Cup challenge', ""He coaxed one last big effort out of those creaking joints in 2009, demolishing the Aussies at Lord's before, uncharacteristically grazing in the outfield rather than catching tracer bullets in the slips, he virtually ensured the return of the urn with the pinpoint run-out of Ricky Ponting at The Oval. And that, sadly, was just about that: the Oval Test was Flintoff's last serious outing on the cricket field. Bullish statements about a comeback to limited-overs cricket were a regular feature of the next 12 months before finally, in September 2010, came the doleful but increasingly inevitable announcement that the body couldn't take it. One of cricket's nearly-greats had gone. "", 'But not quite gone, it turned out. Four years later, a period filled with TV reality shows, expeditions and derring do, he announced his comeback to T20s for Lancashire. Those who feared for him had no need.

Pinging the ball down from the clouds he has the heady blend of pace and trampolining bounce to rattle the best players.  At his best, his potential looks immense, but he is a gentle character given to periods of technical self-doubt and his career has often been fraught with uncertainty. \n"", 'Finn\'s career went into reverse in 2013/14. Issues with his delivery stride - a habit of kneeing the stumps led to a Law change making it a no-ball - and control meant he has been in and out of the side. Endless tinkering with his action then left him visibly bereft of confidence. He was the only member of England\'s vanquished Ashes Test squad not to play in the 5-0 whitewash and cut a forlorn figure on the practice grounds as his action was stripped right back to basics. It all led to him being sent home from England\'s tour of Australia after being deemed ""not selectable"" - an honest and sympathetic assessment - by his one-day coach Ashley Giles.', ""What followed was a long period of rehabilitation and many long hours in winter nets at Finchley CC. In 2014, his 48 first-class wickets showed progress, even if his pace and consistency were inconsistent, but the input of a host of coaches slowly brought dividends and led to his return in England's victorious Ashes series after a two-year absence in which he had been limited only to limited-overs appearances for his country. The unveiling of a new outswinger and the particular joy of a six-wicket haul at Edgbaston gave him the confidence to pronounce that the past was behind him."", ""Finn made his county debut for Middlesex as a 16-year-old in 2005, the youngest to do so since Fred Titmus in 1949, and was earmarked as an England prospect from his early days, representing England at all age-group levels from Under-16s upwards. He enjoyed a solid 2009 season for Middlesex, taking 53 wickets at 30.64 in the Championship, and then did well for England Lions in the UAE. With Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Ryan Sidebottom all picking up injuries early on England's tour to Bangladesh, Finn was parachuted in as cover. Barely 24 hours after arriving in the country he was playing in the warm-up game against Bangladesh A and impressed on his Test debut three days later, displaying good pace and bounce on a docile Chittagong surface."", ""With the England management desperately searching for a consistent replacement for Steve Harmison, Finn marked his home debut, also against Bangladesh, in style. In the familiar surroundings of Lord's, he carried a rusty England attack with 4 for 100 in the first innings and went one better in the second, taking 5 for 87 to finish with nine in the game and the man-of-the-match medal in just his third Test."", ""He kept his place against Pakistan and despite doubts as to whether he was ready for the challenge of a tour of Australia, Finn fronted up impressively in his early outings. He claimed a career-best 6 for 125 to help turn the tide in the first Test at the Gabba, before stepping into the breach left by an injury to Stuart Broad to help seal victory in the second Test at Adelaide. Though he faded at Perth and was omitted from the last two matches, he'd done enough to confirm his promise."", 'A single Test appearance in 2011 followed, during which he became the youngest Englishman to 50 wickets, but Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett moved ahead of him in third-seamer pecking order. An impressive tour of India pushed him firmly into one-day contention, however, and he was a virtual ever-present in limited-overs cricket in 2012, as England briefly topped the ODI rankings but failed in their World Twenty20 defence.', ""Finn won a Test recall against South Africa but a habit of hitting the stumps in his delivery stride became costly when Graeme Smith drew attention to it at Headingley. The umpires decided to call dead ball and Finn was denied Smith's wicket. A few months later, 'Finn's Law' was created, making any wicket taken after a bowler had knocked over the stumps a no ball. "", ""Injury curtailed Finn's involvement in the historic Test series win in India but he was back in the XI in New Zealand, beginning his longest run in the side since his debut. A shortened run-up was experimented with before being abandoned but his rhythm had been affected and, having played just once in England's Champions Trophy campaign, he was dropped after the first Test of the 2013 Ashes. After his tumultuous winter in 2013/14, he rebuilt his confidence with the aid of Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and was rewarded with an ODI recall against India in August 2014. For all the problems, further success in the 2015 Ashes series left England still convinced that Finn was a bowler of rare potential."", ""A stress fracture of the foot ruled him out of a series against Pakistan in the UAE but his recovery on a Lions tour of the Emirates was swift and he was called into England's South Africa squad ahead of the first Test."", ""If the collapse of his action in Australia in 2013/14 was a low point, he was successful enough to proclaim in England's 2015 Ashes victory that his problems were behind him, encouraged by a Test-best 6 for 79 at Edgbaston. He acquitted himself ably enough, too during England's series win in South Africa, only for his career to take another twist when he lost his limited-overs place just as he returned to Test cricket."", 'Another Australia tour beckoned. Finn, who had been out of the Test side for a year,did not make the original party, but he was called up in place of Ben Stokes after Stokes became embroiled in a police investigation after a fracas outside a Bristol night club. Four years after his horrendous Ashes experience, Finn had a chance to make amends only to be rulked out of the tour with a torn left knee cartilage.\n', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2009', 'ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2010', ""Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2010""]",36.0,47,22,279,56,11.16,901,30.96,0,1,36,0,8.0,0.0,69.0,30,13,136,35,8,223,60.98,0,0,11,3,15.0,0.0,21.0,3,3,14,8*,-,19,73.68,0,0,1,0,6.0,0.0,149.0,182,59,1111,56,9.03,2913,38.13,0,1,150,5,47,0,142.0,57,23,368,42*,10.82,569,64.67,0,0,33,8,31,0,88.0,17,12,55,8*,11,65,84.61,0,0,5,0,21,0,36.0,66,6412,3800,125,Jun-79,9/187,30.4,3.55,51.2,6,5,0,69.0,67,3550,2996,102,May-33,May-33,29.37,5.06,34.8,4,2,0,21.0,21,480,583,27,Mar-16,Mar-16,21.59,7.28,17.7,0,0,0,149.0,,26646,15381,531,Sep-37,,28.96,3.46,50.1,29,13,1,142.0,138,6737,5762,200,May-33,May-33,28.81,5.13,33.6,7,3,0,88.0,86,1826,2323,104,Apr-24,Apr-24,22.33,7.63,17.5,2,0,0

If English cricket was still not debating the enforced removal of Kevin Pietersen from international cricket, it was arguing over the conservative approach towards one-day batting at the top of the order. Hales, a tall batsman with a destructive range of offside drives and cuts, was one of a brazen new breed of England batsmen who changed the conversation into something much more positive. \n', 'It took 32 international Twenty20 appearances - strikingly good figures, too, with an average of 38 and a strike rate approaching 140 - before Hales finally won ODI recognition from England selectors who mistrusted his technique against the short ball and his ability to build an innings. ', ""There followed a comparable wait before England considered a further transition - from ODI batsman to Test opener. His 24 ODIs had brought modest success - his average in the mid-20s - but a timely maiden ODI hundred against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi helped to propel him into England's Test squad for their 2015/16 tour of South Africa as he became the eighth opener to try to fill the gap left by Andrew Strauss' Test retirement more than three years earlier. England had exhibited a wish to play a more expansive game at Test level and that worked in his favour."", ""Eleven Tests from the Boxing Day meeting with South Africa in Durban in 2015 until The Oval brought down the curtain on the 2016 English summer against Pakistan represented a decent run in which to establish himself, but he did not take easily to the tempo and technique at Test level. In three successive Tests against Sri Lanka - at Headingley, Chester-le-Street and Lord's - he passed 80 without securing the maiden Test century he craved and which might have been a harbinger for better things. When he chose, along with his limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan, not to tour Bangladesh for safety reasons (the tour passed off uneventfully amid high security) he also found himself omitted from the subsequent India tour because of his doubts about his capacity against spin bowling. "", ""In one-day cricket, though, his prowess was evident. When he lashed 171 during the third ODI against Pakistan on his home soil at Trent Bridge in 2016, he broke the England record previously held by Robin Smith for 23 years. Hales' innings also helped England achieve the highest ever team ODI score in the same game - 444-3, bettering the previous record of 443 by Sri Lanka back in 2006."", 'Off the field, he was present with Ben Stokes when Stokes was charged of affray (for which he was found not guilty) outside a Bristol night club in September 2017; Hales was not charged.', 'Early in February 2018, Hales committed himself solely to limited-overs cricket by signing a white-ball only contract with Nottinghamshire and playing IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad. He had averaged 27.28 in his 11 Tests, and prospects of further opportunities were minimal, although he did signal his intention to reconsider his future after the 2019 World Cup. His ODI form remained occasionally devastating and he struck 147 during that rarest of things - a whitewash in a one-day series against Australia', 'At 6 foot 5, Hales has always hit with a stately intent. His England T20 debut came in 2011, to which he responded after a debut duck against India by scoring an unbeaten 62 off 48 balls as England beat West Indies at the Oval. In his first Twenty20 international of 2012, against West Indies again, he failed by one run to become the first batsman to score a century for England in the short format on his home ground of Trent Bridge, in June. He promised much in a largely ill-starred England campaign in the 2012 World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, although his innings tended to run out of steam. That first hundred by an England batsman finally came in the 2013 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh when he made an unbeaten 116 from 64 balls against Sri Lanka in Chittagong, striking a six over midwicket to secure a last-over victory. ', 'His reputation in T20 cricket grew and he earned a late deal with Melbourne Renegades for two matches of the 2012/13 Big Bash. His debut brought a brutal 89 in just 52 balls at the SCG.', 'In four-day cricket he initially progressed well, earning his county cap after scoring 184 against Somerset at Trent Bridge on his way to topping 1,000 first-class runs in the season for the first time, despite missing almost seven weeks of the campaign with a broken jaw. He added 857 first-class runs in 2012, including two centuries in August.', 'But there followed a disastrous 2013 Championship season in which Hales virtually lost interest and averaged 13.94, being advised by England as a result that he was in danger of becoming a two-dimensional Twenty20 specialist. He decided to work harder on his four-day cricket - although only after he was overlooked in the IPL 2014 draft. English players were often passed over, with their availability so uncertain, but this omission was more curious than many: his reputation had not spread outside England. No matter, he settled into Championship cricket with 954 runs at 50, perhaps his finest Championship season.', ""He had been part of England's ODI squad to the West Indies but missed out on a debut through injury. Finally, three one-day hundreds in as many weeks for Nottinghamshire, including a 96-ball 141 against Middlesex, added to the clamour for his selection.

He cut a similar figure to Alec Stewart with his no-nonsense positivity, even if he did not quite possess the same fastidious attention towards his appearance. \n', ""Prior's reputation reached its peak after England's tour of New Zealand in 2013. He saved the final Test in Auckland, and the series, with a defiant, out-of-character century - batting for four-and-a-half hours for an unbeaten 110, an innings which epitomised England's spirit. He won England's Player of the Year award and his ability to rouse the mood with Churchillian speeches led him to be named as vice captain for the Ashes tour to Australia in 2013-14. But back-to-back Ashes tours treated him unkindly, bringing a marked slump in his form and his keeping standards and he made only one fifty in eight Tests; even that, a counterattacking affair in Perth with the game lost, had an air of desperation. He was dropped for Jonny Bairstow for the final two Tests in Australia and, although he still possessed a Test average above 40, began the 2014 county season with Sussex with his Test spot seriously in question."", ""He was patched up for the first four Tests of the summer - two against Sri Lanka and two against India - but his long-standing Achilles problems severely hampered his wicketkeeping and a subsequent operation revealed such damage that it was amazing he had even taken the field. The last thing he needed was for his commitment to the cause to be demeaned so savagely at the end of the season in Kevin Pietersen's autobiography. He admitted that he was not entirely sure his first-class career could be salvaged and, with an eye to the future, committed his energies to forming a cycling team. With hindsight, it proved a shrewd move and he announced his injury-induced retirement in June 2015."", ""Prior moved to England from South Africa and represented England at all ages, up to and including Under-19s, making his Sussex debut in 2001 as a 19-year-old. He was selected to tour Zimbabwe as part of England's one-day squad in November 2004 and played in just one match, striking 35. He made England's winter squads for Pakistan and India in 2005-06, but played mostly as a batsman in the ODIs and failed to make any real impact. He missed out on the Champions Trophy in October 2006 but was named in the Academy squad to be stationed in Perth during the 2006-07 Ashes series. "", ""Geraint Jones and Chris Read flunked their chances during England's shambolic Ashes campaign, which meant Prior was ready to step into the Test side and launch Peter Moores' period at the helm. He began in thrilling fashion, becoming the first England wicketkeeper to score a century on debut with an unbeaten 126 at Lord's, followed by 75 at Headingley, and England's wicketkeeper problem looked settled. But no sooner was the position sorted than things started going awry. He struggled against India and was a key protagonist in the jellybean fiasco that goaded Zaheer Khan to bowl out England at Trent Bridge before a grim tour to Sri Lanka exposed deep flaws in his keeping. Some misplaced levels of sledging also did not endear him to everybody and he was dropped for England's tour of New Zealand in 2008, with his old Sussex rival, Tim Ambrose - now at Warwickshire - taking the gloves. "", ""But Prior's extra batting class could not be ignored for long, and he returned to the side before the year was out, with his keeping vastly improved during his spell on the outside. He was one of the unsung heroes of England's Ashes triumph in 2009, providing momentum-shifting cameos at No. 6 in the order, and pulling off a series of impressive catches and stumpings. He bettered that effort on the subsequent tour of Australia in 2010-11, claiming 23 catches in the series including an Ashes-record-equalling six in the first innings at Melbourne, and concluded the series with his first hundred against Australia, at Sydney. He made 271 runs at 67.75 during England's 4-0 home triumph against India the following summer as both he and England, who went to No. 1 in the Test rankings, reached a career high.  Fielders standing around point were likely to be under assault if a bowler gave him any width outside off stump. At that juncture he was among several contenders as the most effective wicketkeeper-batsman in Test cricket. "", 'But he never quite convinced England about his aptitude in one-day cricket. For such a belligerent batsman he was a disappointment, especially in ODIs. He was not exactly short of caps - 68 when, at only 29, he played what looked as if it would be his last ODI against Sri Lanka in a 10-wicket hammering in the 2011 World Cup semi-final in Colombo - but an average below 25 and a strike rate of 76 were statistics that must disappoint him.\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2001, 2002, 2003']",79.0,123,21,4099,131*,40.18,6647,61.66,7,28,492,16,243.0,13.0,68.0,62,9,1282,87,24.18,1670,76.76,0,3,141,6,71.0,8.0,10.0,8,2,127,32,21.16,100,127,0,0,11,5,6.0,3.0,249.0,381,44,13228,201*,39.25,19785,66.85,28,75,,,642,41,222.0,204,18,5072,144,27.26,,,4,28,,,187,31,84.0,78,5,1906,117,26.1,1327,143.63,1,11,221,55,46,6,79.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,68.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,10.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,249.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,222.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,84.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

In and out of the side, there were few signs, though, of him running through a side with confidence."", ""Jordan, a right-arm quick bowler born in the home of fast bowling, Barbados, was first spotted in his native land by Bill Athey, who was scouting for a recipient of a cricket scholarship back in England at Dulwich College. He became an exciting prospect at Surrey but failed to emerge as the bowler the county had hoped, not helped by a troubled period in the county's affairs."", ""Jordan was earmarked for great things after Nadeem Shahid, Surrey's Second XI coach, saw five minutes of his all-round ability. Shahid immediately called then first XI coach Alan Butcher to tell him they had a gem on their books. Five days later Jordan was at first team nets. He impressed there and blazed into Surrey's team in August 2007, looking the part immediately at just 18 years old.

Rather than slipping out of the game, he rediscovered his pace and ambition in one of English cricket's story-book recoveries. England, pummelled by the Australian Mitchell Johnson, and eager to find an out-and-out quick bowler of their own, liked what they saw during a Lions recall, and he played the four Tests of the 2014 summer as a shock trooper - two each against Sri Lanka and India - before succumbing to injury.  \n"", ""Plunkett's return was not entirely untroubled; at times his control deserted him and his around-the-wicket approach did not always drum up the anticipated menace. But he stayed true to the exhortations of Yorkshire's coach, Jason Gillespie, to keep it simple and just bowl fast and he took 18 wickets in four Tests, with his match figures of nine for 176 against Sri Lanka on his adopted home ground of Headingley the highlight, a feat overshadowed by Sri Lanka's last-over win. Sternly bearded, with an upright style and strikingly gym-honed upper body, he regularly exceeded speeds of 90mph, but England seemed to conclude that subtlety and control was missing and thereafter chose to utilise him exclusively in white-ball cricket."", ""Plunkett's initial selection for England's tour of Pakistan and India in 2005-06 represented the culmination of a two-year rise to prominence.  A bustling fast-medium seamer blessed with an ability to bowl an occasional unplayable ball and a powerful striker down the order, he briefly promised to have a lengthy international career only for issues with his control - and, in his final season at Durham in 2012, a loss of confidence in his action - to lower his sights."", 'Having made his first-class debut for Durham in 2003, Plunkett took on immediate responsibilities in the absence of Steve Harmison and the injured Mark Davies, and in 2005 took 50 wickets in a season for the first time. He made his Test debut in a thumping England defeat against Pakistan in Lahore, following the withdrawal of Simon Jones with an ankle injury, and announced himself as a capable allrounder with a composed half-century in only his second ODI against the same opposition. ', ""He was selected for England's Ashes campaign in Australia in 2006-7 and for seven gruelling weeks he was the forgotten man of a dismal Test tour. But as England, against all predictions, regrouped to win the one-day series, he seized his opportunity to impress with 12 wickets in the one-day series, including 3 for 43 in the decisive second final against Australia. It was a performance that secured his World Cup passage, though he only played three games and lacked the incisiveness he had shown in Australia."", ""A lack of England engagements freed Plunkett up for his Durham duties, and in 2007 he played a role in their first domestic trophy triumph, in their sixteenth year of first-class status, taking three wickets as Durham won the rain-interrupted Friends Provident final by 125 runs at Lord's. A regular in England Lions squads, Plunkett spent a winter as the Dolphins' overseas player in South Africa in 2007-08 and shared in Durham's Championship success the following summer. Durham retained the title in 2009 and Plunkett was at the forefront of their success with 49 wickets in the season, including match figures of 9 for 149 in the innings win over Nottinghamshire that sealed the title."", ""Plunkett looked set for a second crack at international cricket when he was named in England's squad for their Test series against South Africa in 2009-10, but he was overtaken by the likes of Graham Onions, his Durham team mate, Stuart Broad and Ajmal Shahzad in the fast-bowling ranks and has had to be content with sporadic appearances since. "", 'Subsequently, a combination of injuries and problems with his action saw Plunkett slip down the pecking order at Durham and after two lean seasons, amounting to three Championship appearances, he was told he could look for a new county. Yorkshire took the opportunity to offer him a three-year contract, enabling him to team up again with his former Durham coach, Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket at Headingley, who like Gillespie proved a positive influence. He immediately showed signs of a resurgence, taking 36 wickets in 12 Championship matches. Yorkshire capped him. As he was born in Middlesbrough - part of the old county boundaries  - they felt they had been entitled to him all along. \n', '\n']",[],13.0,20,5,238,55*,15.86,509,46.75,0,1,31,0,3.0,0.0,78.0,45,15,584,56,19.46,588,99.31,0,1,46,17,25.0,0.0,22.0,11,4,42,18,6,34,123.52,0,0,3,1,7.0,0.0,155.0,213,39,4376,126,25.14,,,3,22,,,86,0,200.0,124,45,1586,72,20.07,1575,100.69,0,3,,,61,0,146.0,87,34,777,41,14.66,592,131.25,0,0,55,25,39,0,13.0,25,2659,1536,41,May-64,9/176,37.46,3.46,64.8,1,1,0,78.0,76,3627,3557,116,May-52,May-52,30.66,5.88,31.2,5,1,0,22.0,22,476,627,25,Mar-21,Mar-21,25.08,7.9,19,0,0,0,155.0,,23711,14273,452,Jun-33,,31.57,3.61,52.4,19,11,1,200.0,,8574,7912,257,May-52,May-52,30.78,5.53,33.3,10,1,0,146.0,140,2782,3723,136,May-31,May-31,27.37,8.02,20.4,1,1,0

When he was unceremoniously dumped from England's set up early in 2014, with lawyers at the ready on all sides, he was presented by those in authority as an egotistical individualist whose reluctance to respect those in charge forever undermined attempts to build a strong team ethic. Whatever view you held, Pietersen deserved to be recognised as one of the most captivating cricketers to pull on an England shirt. His flamboyant strokeplay was at the heart of many of England's finest performances for a decade. A brazen belief in his own ability, moments of outrageous unorthodoxy and, at times, a surprising vulnerability on and off the field have all combined to give him great box-office appeal.  \n"", ""His 8,181 Test runs at 47.28 in 104 Tests had few rivals in England's history and his record in limited-overs cricket was also outstanding. In 2013, he became the highest England run-scorer in all international forms of the game combined. But Pietersen's ability to command attention on the field has been matched only by his ability to divide opinion off it. After more than nine years and many controversies, Pietersen's England career was at an end, a fact he wrestled with interminably: accepting it one day, holding out hope of a miraculous return the next. He had no choice but to commit himself to the life of a T20 specialist."", 'For many England cricket fans, no name sparks more excitement. But his celebrity status, individualistic streak and outspoken ways often grated with the England cricket authorities who prefer their star names to be more malleable and conservative. The English media, which has at times been vitriolic - not to say personal - about his rebellious streak has generally recognised that he has few peers.', 'An attempt to introduce him into the inner sanctum, by appointing him England captain in August 2008, lasted only five months as his relationship with the coach, Peter Moores, was uncomfortable from the outset. Their differences simmered throughout a troubled tour of India and when the rift became public Pietersen was forced to resign early in the New Year with a disenchanted Moores sacked on the same day. ', ""Another dispute arose in May 2012 when Pietersen, agitating for the freedom to play for longer in the Indian Premier League - where his popularity was unquestioned - briefly announced his retirement from all forms of limited-overs international cricket. Pietersen's frustration had a disruptive effect on England's summer Test series against South Africa. The ECB regarded the matter as an unacceptable display of player power. He was dropped for the final Test at The Oval and omitted from World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England predictable struggling in his absence."", ""Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg to an Afrikaner father, Jannie, and an English mother, Penny, and abandoned South Africa cricket as a teenager in protest against the racial quota system which he felt was unfairly restricting his opportunities at KwaZulu Natal. He joined Nottinghamshire in 2000, attracted by the chance to work with Clive Rice, the county's coach and a former South Africa allrounder, but left at the end of the 2003 season after Nottinghamshire were relegated, unhappy with the standard of the Trent Bridge pitches and expressed his feelings strongly enough for the captain, Jason Gallian, to fling his kit out of the dressing room window. He signed for Hampshire, where he remained until 2010, at which point he decamped to Surrey to be close to his Chelsea home, but by then his county appearances had long become sporadic."", 'His England career began in a low-key one-day series in Zimbabwe in 2004 when Andrew Flintoff was ""rested"" after expressing moral misgivings about the political regime of Robert Mugabe. Pietersen averaged 104 in England\'s 4-0 victory. A subsequent tour of South Africa was more daunting, but he produced three audacious centuries in the series, his unbeaten 100 in 69 balls becoming England\'s quickest ODI hundred. He went on to reach 1000 one-day runs in just 21 innings - equalling Viv Richards\' record. ', ""Test cricket beckoned with the 2005 Ashes the following summer: Pietersen's selection ahead of Graham Thorpe representing the toughest selectorial decision of early summer. He sealed the return of the urn after 17 years with a stroke-filled 158 at The Oval on the final day of the series. England needed to avoid defeat to regain the Ashes and Pietersen was dropped three times on the way to 60, but tension gave way to scenes of jubilation as his adrenalin-charged climax included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for England in an Ashes Test. He was named man of the match, finished an uneven series as top scorer, with 473 runs at 52.55 and, like the rest of the side, was awarded an MBE amid an atmosphere of national jubilation. He was also named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year."", ""The subsequent years were a whirl of exciting innings, occasional rash dismissals and celebrity engagements. Sri Lanka's visit to England in 2006 was a high point. He matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first Test and in the following Test at Edgbaston, to general incredulity he unveiled the Switch Hit as he reversed his stance to slog-sweep Muttiah Muralitharan for six. There was no more appropriate way for a player of Pietersen's razzamatazz to become the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings in England. The MCC ruled in 2008 that the shot was legal. He was up for the challenge, too, in Australia in 2006-7, averaging more than 50, and in the World Cup which followed, but England were a ramshackle lot as Flintoff, the captain, and coach Duncan Fletcher rarely had a meeting of minds. "", ""Soon it was time for his ill-fated tilt at the England captaincy. His tenure officially began when Michael Vaughan, the Test captain, retired and Paul Collingwood stood down as ODI captain at the same time. Pietersen started with a century and victory against South Africa at The Oval but that was perhaps as close as he ever got to acceptance from the establishment. England's ODI series against India ended prematurely because of terrorist attacks on Mumbai, but England returned to fulfil the Test tour amid unprecedented security as Pietersen expressed the need not to be cowed by terrorism. But behind the scenes Pietersen's relationship was deteriorating with Moores, a coach with no international experience and an unrelenting work ethic. Pietersen recommended, rather too publicly, that Moores be removed and got his way, only to be summarily sacked as well. His relationship with the ECB never entirely recovered. Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower, who took over as captain and coach, had much healing to undertake."", ""Alongside brushes with management - a feature in all the teams he has played for - injuries have interrupted him at key moments. His 2009 Ashes campaign was cut short by leg trouble that needed surgery and he left the 2011 World Cup with a hernia. His form became mercurial rather than reliable and he seemed to develop a curious fallibility against a succession of left-arm spinners, some more renowned than others. But he ended a 20-month wait for an international century by making a career-best 227 as England won the Ashes in Australia for the first time in 24 years, then scored 533 runs at 106.60 in England's 4-0 home whitewashing of India that secured them the No.1 ranking in Tests. His reputation as one of England's greats could no longer be denied."", ""He was also the Man of the Tournament in England's World Twenty20 win in 2010 but his one-day batting tailed off, with no centuries over a three-year period between 2009 and 2011. He scored two in successive innings against Pakistan in 2012 - including his highest ODI score of 130 - and, briefly, it appeared they would be his last innings in coloured kit for England when he announced his retirement from limited-overs internationals, briefly seduced by the attractions of IPL. "", 'England\'s Test against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 captured his career in microcosm. His power struggle with the ECB had left him moody and unpredictable before the Test, but when the match began he struck a quite brilliant 149 and, in the process, became the fastest man in terms of time, to reach 7,000 Test runs. That was quickly followed by more off-field drama, as reports of derogatory text messages about his captain, Strauss, to South Africa players, filled the media. Pietersen was dropped for the next Test at Lord\'s and, even though he did an about turn and reconfirmed his desire to play for England in all formats, forgiveness did not come quickly enough for him to play in World Twenty20. When he was officially invited back into the ranks, in Colombo, he had to sit next to the ECB chairman, Giles Clarke, as details of his ""reintegration process"" were sternly issued.  His response was to bat as well as ever. His 186 in Mumbai was a jewel in England\'s crown as they won a Test series in India for the first time in 28 years.', 'The detente was short-lived, however, as cracks reappeared on England\'s disastrous 2013-14 tour of Australia where, despite being the leading run-scorer - a modest achievement in the circumstances - rumours surfaced of a further deterioration in his relationship with Flower. Although Flower himself resigned, the ECB decided to cut its losses a few days later and summarily brought down the curtain on Pietersen\'s England career as well, citing a need to rebuilt ""team ethic and philosophy"". An autobiography published later that year was arguably the most outspoken in cricket history as he launched an emotional attack on those he felt had wronged him. It was a desperately sad end.\n', '\n']","['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC One-Day Player of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE on 31st December 2005', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2006']",104.0,181,8,8181,227,47.28,13255,61.72,23,35,985,81,62.0,0.0,136.0,125,16,4440,130,40.73,5128,86.58,9,25,427,77,40.0,0.0,37.0,36,5,1176,79,37.93,831,141.51,0,7,119,32,14.0,0.0,217.0,358,26,16522,355*,49.76,,,50,71,,,152,0,253.0,233,34,8112,147,40.76,,,15,46,,,85,0,200.0,193,25,5695,115*,33.89,4160,136.89,3,35,495,220,66,0,104.0,58,1311,886,10,Mar-52,Apr-78,88.6,4.05,131.1,0,0,0,136.0,23,400,370,7,Feb-22,Feb-22,52.85,5.55,57.1,0,0,0,37.0,3,30,53,1,Jan-27,Jan-27,53,10.6,30,0,0,0,217.0,,6443,3760,73,Apr-31,,51.5,3.5,88.2,,0,0,253.0,,2390,2122,41,Mar-14,Mar-14,51.75,5.32,58.2,0,0,0,200.0,30,396,534,17,Mar-33,Mar-33,31.41,8.09,23.2,0,0,0

He represented England at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 levels, and was awarded the Test Match Special Young Cricketer of the Year award in 2000 for his impressive performances in the Under-15 World Cup. He made his debut for Nottinghamshire 2nd XI at the age of just 14, in late 1999 but it wasn't until 2006 that he finally began to show signs of realising his potential, scoring 156 not out against Middlesex, an innings in which he went from 100 to 150 in just 17 balls."", ""Some of his most eye-catching performances came in Twenty20, including a unique double-wicket maiden against Derbyshire in 2006, but it was in 50-over cricket that he first attracted the interest of England's selectors, who picked him in his first international squad for the 2008 Champions Trophy. "", 'Patel impressed during his breakthrough season in 2008 where he played 11 ODIs in 2008, particularly during a haul of 5 for 41 to beat South Africa at The Oval. But instead of kicking on to greater things, his career stagnated, amid repeated failures to respond to the cajoling of the England management, and get into the gym to sort out his waistline. The county circuit did not lack for stories about accidents on treadmills or his penchant for chocolate bars', 'England\'s frustration was at its height ahead of the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent. England desperately wanted to be able to include him for the slow, low wickets of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and named him in their 30-man provisional squad, with the expectation that he would respond accordingly.

Patel worked hard enough at his fitness before the 2011 season to have reached the basic targets laid out by England and he was rewarded with a recall to the limited-overs set-up after a strong start to the summer with Nottinghamshire, his first involvement for two-and-a-half years.', ""His work paid off as he passed 1,000 runs in a season for the first time and took 33 wickets for Nottinghamshire. He was one of few players to come out of England's ill-fated one-day tour of India in credit with 160 runs 40.00."", ""Patel was an England regular in limited-overs cricket when he earned a first Test call up for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012.  Despite a modest domestic season in which he passed 50 only three times in first-class matches and had a top score of only 69, he was also selected for England's 2012-13 tour of India, where he made his first century in a senior England side in a warm-up match against India A and was selected for the first three Tests without ever making an impact. He then failed to win selection for World Twenty20 in Bangladesh shortly after predicting that, at 29, he was approaching his peak and had ambitions to play 200 times for England. Instead, he feared that total might end on 60.."", 'His slow left-arm was never more valuable for Notts than when a spell of 3 for 21 from seven overs helped Nottinghamshire beat Glamorgan by 87 runs in the 2013 YB40 final at Lord\'s to win their first limited-overs trophy for more than 20 years. But England\'s declining interest - even with his director of cricket Mick Newell now ensconced as a selector - began to weigh on him. With his Test ambitions high at the start of 2014, he averaged 52, only to average 23 after he failed be selected. Newell himself called that ""no coincidence"".', ""That run shortage continued in 2015, only for him to win a surprise call-up as England's third spinner for a Test series against Pakistan in the UAE, his chance coming when Zafar Ansari was injured in the field hours after being selected. Patel got his chance in the final Test, a victory for Pakistan which sealed the series, leaving the media - and the ECB - to agonise over discouraging conditions for English spinners in county cricket."", 'Never mind: in the county game, his best was yet to come. Patel was at the forefront of Nottinghamshire\'s excellent season in 2017 in which they regained their First Division place in the Championship at the first attempt and won both limited-overs trophies. His unbeaten 122 against Essex at Chelmsford as Notts pulled off a record 50-over chase in the semi-final was not just a fine innings but wonderful theatre. He took the man-of-the-match award in the T20 final at Edgbaston for his 64 off 42 balls against Birmingham Bears, completing his second run-out of Finals Day for added theatre. He then bemoaned - as was his habit - that England\'s selectors had not been in touch. Patel won both the PCA\'s Most Valuable Player award and the Players\' Player award - the first recognition for a Notts player since Richard Hadlee 30 years earlier. He had not always had the happiest relationship with England, but the accolade from his fellow professionals was a show of respect that left him ""chuffed to bits"".', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2007'],6.0,9,0,151,42,16.77,338,44.67,0,0,16,1,3.0,0.0,36.0,22,7,482,70*,32.13,517,93.23,0,1,37,12,7.0,0.0,18.0,14,2,189,67,15.75,173,109.24,0,1,17,5,3.0,0.0,212.0,345,18,11976,257*,36.62,18927,63.27,26,59,,,134,0,236.0,205,32,6060,129*,35.02,7093,85.43,7,33,,,68,0,246.0,215,38,4577,90*,25.85,3673,124.61,0,28,426,132,73,0,6.0,10,858,421,7,Feb-27,3/164,60.14,2.94,122.5,0,0,0,36.0,32,1187,1091,24,May-41,May-41,45.45,5.51,49.4,0,1,0,18.0,15,252,321,7,02-Jun,02-Jun,45.85,7.64,36,0,0,0,212.0,,24465,12558,322,Jul-68,,39,3.07,75.9,11,5,1,236.0,,7940,7127,217,Jun-13,Jun-13,32.84,5.38,36.5,3,2,0,246.0,224,4469,5420,203,Apr-20,Apr-20,26.69,7.27,22,2,0,0

Despite receiving a broken arm courtesy of throwdowns from Peter Moores, then Lancashire's coach, he did enough to catch the eye of the England selectors who called him up for the tour of West Indies and World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. Strikingly, his 5 for 17 in a 40-overs match against Surrey at Old Trafford had only been exceeded once before by a Lancashire bowler in one-day cricket. "", 'He made his ODI debut against West Indies, in Antigua, on trip dominated by spin bowling and acquitted himself well, his 3 for 32 enough to take the man-of-the-match award.  Two T20 internationals followed in Barbados ahead of one game in the World T20 in Bangladesh later that month, but he was discarded after his fifth T20I, this time against Pakistan in Dubai, at the end of 2015.', ""Ashley Giles, then England's one-day coach, gave him opportunities in T20 and ODI cricket and the pair joined forces again at the end of 2014 when Giles, sacked from his England role, became Lancashire's director of cricket."", ""But it was Glen Chapple, Giles' successor, who finally gave him regular Championship opportunities. Ten years after his five wickets on first-class debut, he achieved it for a second time as Lancashire's defeat of Middlesex consigned them to a path that would end in relegation.

Graeme Swann made his England debut as a raw 20-year-old in 2000, in a nondescript one-day international in Bloemfontein, but it was a brief foray into the top level. Eight years later, having learnt his trade on the county scene with Northamptonshire and then Nottinghamshire, his Test debut came against India, at Chennai, and from that point he never looked back, becoming one of England's greatest spinners. \n"", ""In 60 Tests, he took 255 wickets at a touch under 30 runs apiece in a little more than five years, prolific wicket-taking exceeding anyone else in Test cricket in that period, with James  Anderson (232), Stuart Broad (207) and Dale Steyn (205) behind him. He retired as England's sixth highest wicket-taker, the leading offspinner and second among all England slow bowlers only to Derek Underwood, who took 297 wickets. He was wonderfully adaptable: attuned when necessary to a defensive role to allow the quicks in England's four-strong attack time to rest, and also blessed with the ability to dip and turn the ball markedly. He was also one of England's great character cricketers, refreshingly individualistic on and off the field, bringing fun wherever he played. He was a fine slip fielder, too, although the hours spent in the field, and the training grind necessary to achieve peak physical fitness, did not always some naturally to him."", ""As the new millennium dawned, there was a fear that traditional offspinners were becoming defunct at the highest level. Swann was one of a special band who challenged the notion. He did not have a doosra, but he had cunning, flight and turn. He was also helped by a striking number of left-handed batsmen at the highest levels and a growing use of technology which made it more likely that umpires would uphold lbw appeals. Of his 255 wickets, 70 were lbw, compared to Laker's 32 from 193; 121 of his victims were left-handers whereas Laker only returned 32. When he retired, he felt irreplaceable."", ""His debut at Chennai was marked by two wickets in his first over - the knack of striking in his first over would be a skill that stayed with him - and within a few months he had usurped Monty Panesar as England's premier spinner, a position he would not relinquish. Swann loved a wise-crack (his 2010-11 Ashes video diary became an internet hit) - a trait that did not endear him to all early in his career - but it would be unfair merely to brand him as a dressing-room joker. He was the ultimate competitor on the field, often bordering on feisty, and a master of his craft. His record showed the value of developing at domestic level and the fact he was pulled out of the international game as a youngster, almost as quickly as he was handed his chance, with the severe England coach at the time, Duncan Fletcher, not alone in regarding him as somewhat immature, perhaps saved him from being overwhelmed before he was ready."", ""After biding his time on the domestic circuit, he soon became a matchwinner at Test level and a key part of both the one-day side and Twenty20 sides. After a successful tour of West Indies (albeit in a losing cause) he played a key role in the 2009 Ashes victories at Lord's and The Oval. Further incisive spells followed over the years to come: South Africa in Durban, Bangladesh in Chittagong, Pakistan at Edgbaston and Lord's, Australia in Adelaide, Sri Lanka in Cardiff, India at The Oval, Sri Lanka in Colombo."", ""During the 2012 home season, Swann's career hit a blip. The snap and spark in his bowling disappeared for a time as he was superbly played by Hashim Amla. For only the second time in his Test career he was dropped: the Test at Headingley became infamous for a text-message furore which engulfed Kevin Pietersen. However, the following winter Swann was back to being a central figure, helping England to an historic series win in India, his alliance with Monty Panesar as they claimed 19 of the 20 wickets to fall representing one of the greatest spin-bowling double acts in England's Test history. "", ' dubbed them ""the dust devils"".', ""A recurrence of a long-standing elbow problem, which he has been forced to manage throughout his career, meant he required surgery in early 2013 and England were forced to contemplate life without Swann. He was back for that summer's Ashes, and took 26 wickets without ever being at his best, but he would not last the return series in Australia. The third Test in Perth proved to be his last. The last ball bowled he bowled in Test cricket flew deep into the Prindiville Stand at wide long-on; his final over went for 22, all to the whirring blade of Shane Watson. Seven wickets at 80 in the series, as he failed to get enough revolutions on the ball to remain a threat, represented an unhappy end."", 'With the Ashes lost after three Tests, Swann announced his retirement four days before the Boxing Day Test.  A tour which had started with such promise for England was by then in disarray: Jonathan Trott, the long-serving No 3, had already departed with a stress-related illness.  Swann\'s failure to see out the tour - even if only for appearances\' sake - brought some accusations of selfishness, but his elbow had become increasingly debilitating and, if the manner of his parting did not find universal approval, he had served England with distinction and provided endless fun along the way. He admitted later that he felt ""horrendous"" about quitting when he did, but on his career as a whole, he was in no doubt.

With his black patka, wide eyes and eager (if a touch hapless) fielding, he rapidly became a fan favourite.  \n', 'After years of limited and negative England spinners, Panesar was a revelation. His languid action deeply excited England supporters and even on the occasions when sharp turn was not forthcoming that was belied by an effervescence apparent in his cherubic and unconfined celebrations at the fall of each and every wicket. Like a lamb let loose from the paddock, he cut a joyful figure. ', 'For a time, he was considered the saviour of English spin bowling, but that position was usurped by the emergence of his old Northants colleague Graeme Swann, who had greater command of spin and dip on flat surfaces and who also had a shrewdness about him which Panesar occasionally seemed to lack. They combined in spectacular fashion, however, in Mumbai in November 2012, dubbed the ""dust devils"" as they returned joint figures of 19 for 323, in one of the greatest England spin double acts in history, only the fourth occasion that England spinners had combined to take 19 wickets or more wickets in a Test and the first time for 54 years.', ""When Swann retired midway through England's Ashes debacle in 2013-14, debilitated by elbow trouble, Panesar should have been ready to step in. But his career was by then in question. He left Sussex under a cloud in 2013 after urinating from on high upon a nightclub bouncer in the early hours of the morning, and his behaviour on long tours had its eccentric moments. He joined Essex, with his many fans hoping that it would revive a faltering career, but despite respectable returns in his first full season at Chelmsford the rise of Moeen Ali looked to have consigned his England days to the past."", ""A Luton lad by birth he progressed through Northamptonshire's youth teams and was picked for England Under-19s in 2000. He marked his first-class debut a year later against Leicestershire with a match haul of 8 for 131. Opportunities thereafter were limited but a fine 2005 season kick-started his career. He took 46 Championship wickets at 21.54, and spent part of the winter at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide. That was enough for Panesar to be picked for England's 2006 tour of India in February. He made his Test debut at Nagpur picking up his boyhood hero, Sachin Tendulkar, as his first Test wicket and Rahul Dravid as his third."", ""The following summer, against Pakistan, Panesar attracted national headlines, even beyond the game, by spinning England to a series win. At Old Trafford he made the most of a helpful surface with eight wickets then, at Headingley, he was England's best bowler on a run-filled strip. The loop, guile and changes of pace outfoxed Pakistan's top-order, including Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan."", ""In a matter of months he had elevated himself to the position of England's senior spinner, pushing aside Ashley Giles. Yet Duncan Fletcher - ever the loyalist, rarely the risk-taker - preferred a rusty Giles for the first two Tests of the 2006-07 Ashes. England were thrashed in both but Monty got a chance in the third at Perth, becoming the first English spinner to take five at the WACA (and eight in the match). As England crashed to a humiliating 5-0 defeat, Panesar was one of the precious few to return home with their reputation intact."", ""He started the 2007 summer with 23 wickets in four Tests against West Indies, which brought a career-high No. 6 ranking, but things began to go awry thereafter. He struggled in the following home series against India, and away in Sri Lanka, where he lost his confidence and misunderstood mutterings began about his lack of variety. Though he fared well in New Zealand a tough 2008 summer, where Graeme Smith swept him to distraction in South Africa's series-clinching win in Edgbaston, blunted his cheerful persona. "", ""He was comprehensively outperformed by a resurgent Swann during his return to India in December 2008, and again in the Caribbean, where he lost his position as England's No. 1 spinner. The bowling lacked spark but more significantly, so did the man. Lost in a confusion of 'expert' opinion around him, he lost faith in his method. That trend continued in the first Test of the 2009 Ashes at Cardiff, where he and Swann both underperformed with the ball, claiming one wicket between them. However, by batting through to the close in a remarkable tenth-wicket stand with James Anderson, Panesar reaffirmed his cult status. That was as good as the summer got for him though as his bowling form slumped and he lost his central contract. "", ""By the end of 2009 the future of Panesar's international career looked doubtful but he took control by leaving his life-long county Northamptonshire and moving to Sussex. Trusted to set his fields and take a senior role in the dressing room he rediscovered his vim. A strong 2010 season saw a return to the England squad for the Ashes win. On the 2012 winter tour to UAE he finally got his chance for England again, picking up 14 wickets at 22 from his two Tests against Pakistan, but opportunities continued to be sporadic."", 'There followed a disturbing deterioration in both his professional and personal life. He was released by Sussex late in the 2013 season after urinating on high on a Brighton nightclub bouncer after he had been asked to leave. After a loan spell at Northants, it was Essex who gambled on him, but his form remained unconvincing and there were reports of unpredictable and difficult behaviour as he was left out of the side for long periods. By the time Essex also let him go, in September 2015, he had taken 67 wickets in 24 first-class games (all in Division Two) at 28.62 and  was back with his long-time mentor, Neil Burns, following a holistic approach to his career which emphasised personal and mental welfare alongside cricketing skills.

5 ft 11 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Left-arm medium,,,,"[""\nUpstanding, self-effacing and privately educated, Andrew Strauss was the archetypical England captain, and one of their most successful ones. His understated authority underpinned England's rise to the top of the world rankings - for the first time in 31 years, according to back-dated calculations - in a journey that included a home Ashes win in 2009, an even sweeter victory in Australia for the first time since 1986-87, and a 4-0 whitewash to usurp No. 1-ranked India in 2011. \n"", 'A compact left-handed opener, Strauss was severe on the cut shot, efficient off his pads and workmanlike everywhere else. Though most comfortable with pace on the ball, Strauss made two centuries against an Australian attack that included Shane Warne in 2005 and tenacious back-to-back hundreds against India in Chennai in 2008. ', ""His early county cricket with Middlesex did not exactly suggest a star in the making, but a century in 2003 against Lancashire, with Andrew Flintoff haring in, set the selectors sniffing - and also made Strauss believe he had what it took. After a few one-day caps that winter, Strauss was called up for the first Test against New Zealand in 2004 after Michael Vaughan twisted his knee in the Lord's nets. Strauss responded with a confident century, and was on his way to another in the second innings when Nasser Hussain ran him out 17 short. But Hussain had seen enough: with Vaughan set to return, he announced his immediate retirement and Strauss's England career was set.  \t"", 'Strauss flirted with England captaincy in 2006 - dubbing himself ""the stand-in for the stand-in"" in the absence of the injured Vaughan and Flintoff -  and led England to victory at home against Pakistan. Universally admired by his team-mates, it now seems bizarre that a natural leader would ever be overlooked for the captaincy but that\'s exactly what happened for Ashes the following winter.  Flintoff was chosen instead as England flunked to 5-0 loss. It was the first disappointment in Strauss\'s Test career and instigated a slump in form that saw him go 15 matches without a Test hundred. With his England spot looking desperately insecure he produced a eight-hour 177, his highest Test score, to seal a series win in Napier and salvage his career. ', ""His form flooded back and when Kevin Pietersen - Vaughan's successor as captain - and coach Peter Moores fell out spectacularly, England turned to the steadiest pair of hands. He forged a partnership with new team director Andy Flower in 2009 and the 'Andocracy' has since reached almost hallowed status. "", 'During the early part of his England career hundreds came apace - with 10 in his first 30 games - but captaincy, as it so often does, dented his form. Despite centuries in the 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes, Strauss struggled elsewhere and when England lost four consecutive Tests in the 2011-12 winter, murmurings began about his future. But Strauss stayed true to himself - affable, calm and respectful - and began the 2012 season with two hundreds against West Indies to put him within touching distance of the most by an England batsman. However, soon after that, Strauss had a terrible both on and off the field against South Africa - England lost the series 2-0 and with it the number one ranking, Strauss scored 107 runs in six innings, and the Pietersen controversy went from bad to worse. A week after the end of that Test series, Strauss announced his retirement from all international cricket, having played 100 Tests, and having led England to victory in 24 out of 50 Tests in charge.']","['Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005', 'Awarded the OBE in June 2011']",100.0,178,6,7037,177,40.91,14385,48.91,21,27,867,10,121.0,0.0,127.0,126,8,4205,158,35.63,5195,80.94,6,27,454,25,57.0,0.0,4.0,4,0,73,33,18.25,64,114.06,0,0,9,0,1.0,0.0,241.0,424,25,17046,241*,42.72,,,46,74,,,228,0,254.0,247,14,7631,163,32.75,,,10,49,,,90,0,28.0,28,0,519,60,18.53,442,117.42,0,2,73,3,12,0,100.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,127.0,1,6,3,0,-,-,-,3,-,0,0,0,4.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,241.0,,132,142,3,Jan-16,,47.33,6.45,44,,0,0,254.0,,6,3,0,-,-,-,3,-,0,0,0,28.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

He damaged anterior cruciate ligaments and damaged his cartilage when he landed awkwardly while celebrating the dismissal of Moeen Ali in a NatWest Blast tie against Worcestershire and missed the rest of the season in embarrassing circumstances.  The possibility that he could spend up to a year out of the game did not dissuade nine counties from chasing his signature before he opted to join Warwickshire on a three-year deal. \n"", ""England were watching Stone's recovery with concern, too, because he bowled some of the fastest spells in county cricket in 2015 and was selected for an England Performance Programme development camp bin South Africa before he was beset by the back trouble that had also afflicted him earlier in his career. The highlight was a career-best 5 for 44 against Kent, extolled by his captain Alex Wakely as one of the quickest spells he had seen while in the field."", ""Stone, from Norwich, starred for England Under-19s on their tour of South Africa in February 2013 and registered the best match bowling figures for England in a youth Test with a return of 11 for 79 against South Africa Under-19s in Paarl. He broke the record set by Richard Pearson in 1991. He also filled in as skipper for Shiv Thakor. Northants increasingly benefited from his developing threat. In five Championship matches in Northants' abject Division One season in 2014 he was not overawed by the experience and, approaching his 21st birthday, finished top of the county's Championship averages. "", 'His comeback eventually came mid-way through the 2017 season.

And it's true that Ben Stokes' combative nature, allied to his powerful frame and outrageous talent, lifted a somewhat diffident England side to another level. Capable of turning games with his batting, his bowling and in the field - through his character as much as his deeds - Stokes soon attracted comparisons with Ian Botham. Expectations were huge. \n"", 'It is his misfortune therefore that he may be most remembered for two episodes he would rather forget. The first came in the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup final in Kolkata. Asked to defend 19 in the last over against West Indies, his attempted yorkers missed the mark by inches resulting in Carlos Brathwaite heaving him for four successive sixes into a sweltering night sky.', ""The second, and altogether more serious, incident occurred in September 2017. Celebrating an ODI victory in Bristol, Stokes became embroiled in a fight outside a club in the early hours of the morning that resulted in his arrest. A trial at Bristol Crown Court subsequently saw him cleared of the charge of affray but by then the reputational damage had been done. He had already missed the 2017-18 Ashes tour - a toothless England were beaten 4-0 with Stokes not considered for selection - and been stripped of the team's vice-captaincy. "", 'He could console himself with the knowledge that he had the time and the ability to ensure he was remembered for more positive reasons. Within months of his comeback, Stokes had played a key role in England\'s 3-0 Test win in Sri Lanka, their first whitewash series victory in Asia. Trevor Bayliss praised Stokes\' attitude as ""exemplary"", saying he had ""learned his lesson"". ', 'Stokes, from the moment he made his Durham debut, felt very much a product of the northeast of England. He was actually born in Christchurch, New Zealand and came from a rich sporting pedigree with his father, Ged, playing international Rugby League for that country.', 'His prodigious talent was clear from an early age. A true allrounder, Stokes debuted for Durham at 17 and dismissed Mark Ramprakash with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. He enjoyed a productive time at the 2009 Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham. But it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over, and a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact.', ""A first brush with the management was to follow, after being called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013. Stokes ended up being sent home with three matches remaining, along with Kent's Matt Coles, after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment, and he was rapidly rehabilitated back at Durham, playing a key role in their Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. He took a maiden ODI five-for and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, a return to Australia that would command attention for the right reasons."", ""Stokes' performances were a rare bright spot on a disastrous trip. When the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England as a star on the rise. Brought into the XI at Adelaide, after Jonathan Trott's untimely departure, his pugnacious nature came to the fore during a maiden Test hundred in Perth, a doughty response out of keeping with England's general demeanour throughout the tour."", 'But with fire came combustibility. Stokes missed the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after reacting to a dismissal in Barbados by punching a dressing room locker and sustaining a broken wrist. During a difficult year, he was dropped from the Test team after making three ducks in a row against India, and then lost his one-day place on the tour of Sri Lanka - ultimately missing out on selection for the 2015 World Cup.', ""Stokes, like England after a dismal tournament, needed rejuvenating. It began with the Lord's Test against New Zealand, when Stokes scored 92 and 101 after being promoted to bat at No. 6. A successful Ashes followed and he was also a central figure in the new-look ODI side that began to put the World Cup behind them under the guidance of Bayliss and Paul Farbrace. A few months later he produced a barnstorming 258 from 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town - the fastest England double-hundred in history and the second fastest of all time - during a stand of 399 with Jonny Bairstow."", ""Following his Kolkata nightmare, he nevertheless grew in stature within the side and was promoted to the vice-captaincy (at least until the Bristol episode). He scored his maiden ODI hundred in Dhaka in late 2016 and added four more across international formats the following year, while also taking Test-best figures of 6 for 22 against West Indies at Lord's, becoming a key cog for England despite a chequered injury record."", 'An IPL millionaire twice over - he was bought for £1.7m by Rising Pune Supergiant in 2017, winning tournament MVP, and then picked up for £1.4m the following season by Rajasthan Royals - Stokes was one of the most talked-about players in the world. But there was a sense the best was yet to come. Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent.

For Roy, a Surrey opener of dashing disposition, such a change of emphasis was ideal. His maiden ODI ton had come before the World Cup, against Pakistan in Dubai, but it was in 2016 under the leadership of Eoin Morgan, adamant that England must play free-spirited cricket, that Roy found his voice, making two ODI hundreds against Sri Lanka in England, the second of them - a career-best 162, the second highest ODI score made at the time by an England batsman - coming in front of his adoring home crowd at The Oval. \n"", ""There was even better to come. In banishing the blues of an Ashes Test thrashing in 2017-18, Roy surpassed Alex Hales' record one-day score for England of 171 with 180 in Melbourne as Australia recognised an England one-day side performing with a freedom of expression that surpassed anything they could muster in response. This was far removed from the batsman who had endured such a dud season in Australia's Big Bash competition."", ""Born in South Africa, Roy came to the UK aged 10 and soon started to move through the system. He was a hugely successful schoolboy cricketer for Whitgift, and made his Surrey debut as a 17-year-old in 2008 during the Twenty20 Cup and his fielding talents were noticed by England, who used him as a sub later that summer against South Africa. It wasn't until 2010 that he broke into the first team again. He promptly thumped 101 off 57 balls against Kent at Beckenham, Surrey's first T20 hundred. Later in the summer he struck an unbeaten 76 from 65 balls against Leicestershire on Championship debut. England's selectors gave him a place on the Performance Programme tour to India before the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka in early 2012."", ""Roy's obvious ability in the shorter formats led to him twice winning T20 contracts in the Bangladesh Premier League but he struggled to build on a quietly impressive role in Surrey's 2011 promotion campaign, when he made his maiden first-class hundred. In 2013, he made two YB40 centuries - doubling his List A tally - but struggled badly in Championship cricket, scoring just 49 runs in seven innings."", ""It was in 2014 that Roy made the leap from a prodigiously talented but erratic young cricketer to a consistent match-winner. The transformation was particularly evident in the NatWest T20 Blast, where he struck 677 runs at 48.35 apiece - the highest tally in the competition. England's T20 competition had undeniably produced an exciting batsman of international quality. Roy's uncomplicated clean-striking became as much a feature of Friday nights at The Oval as the beer-snakes and streakers. With his breathtaking power down the ground and penchant for switch-hitting - not to mention the fact he was born in South Africa - he was frequently compared to Kevin Pietersen, not least by Pietersen himself. His brilliance did not achieve the same levels in the following two summers - how could it? - but a destructive hundred against Somerset in 2015, and against Kent the following year, was a reminder of his unfettered talent."", 'After working hard on pacing his innings in four-day cricket, Roy also blossomed in Championship cricket in 2014, hitting 1078 runs, the highest at the club, at an average of 50-plus without reigning in his destructiveness: his strike rate was still 84. He also averaged 47.65 in the Championship in a promotion year in 2015, his strike rate even higher.  ', ""By the summer's end, he was rewarded with a T20 international debut against India and in 2015 he became a fixture in England's limited-overs formats, building on a couple of promising 60s against Australia with a maiden ODI ton against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi, an innings that was rarely fluent - and that was entirely overshadowed by Jos Buttler's dash to his own hundred in record time - but one that provided proof of a growing survival mentality."", 'Kevin Pietersen, a former Surrey team-mate as well as also sharing a South African birthplace, called for Roy to bat at No 6 for England in Tests the following summer, saying it would make England fans ""so happy"". Although Pietersen seemed oblivious to it, Roy\'s international form had faltered. He had failed to pass 20 in nine ODI innings and was eventually dropped from England\'s Champions Trophy side, but his form rebounded with 84 and 96 in late-September ODIs against West Indies.  ', 'Those crowd-pleasing innings came along less often than England would have hoped, keeping his average not far above 30, but when they came they were spectacular, communicating the devil-may-care approach of an exciting England side that found itself top of the ODI rankings a year or so before contesting the World Cup on home soil. As well as the Melbourne 180 (which also included a record-breaking 221 stand for the third wicket with Joe Root), there were further hundreds against Australia in Cardiff and Chester-le-Street, often accompanied by the plaintiff - and ignored - cry from Pietersen that his imagined protégé should win a chance at Test level.', '\n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73.0,71,2,2661,180,38.56,2522,105.51,7,12,314,45,29.0,0.0,32.0,32,0,743,78,23.21,512,145.11,0,4,75,35,5.0,0.0,81.0,132,11,4645,143,38.38,5657,82.11,9,22,618,72,73.0,0.0,166.0,159,7,5658,180,37.22,5309,106.57,14,28,685,96,66.0,0.0,192.0,188,9,4882,122*,27.27,3349,145.77,4,31,531,193,83.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,73.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,32.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,81.0,25,712,495,14,03-Sep,Apr-47,35.35,4.17,50.8,0,0,0,166.0,1,6,12,0,-,-,-,12,-,0,0,0,192.0,2,18,39,1,Jan-23,Jan-23,39,13,18,0,0,0

The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India. It was understandable that there were a few fears for Root's future workload. He was rare among England batsmen in achieving maturity so quickly, and had looked consumed by the delights of batting from the moment he first took guard. Now he had new responsibilities.  \n"", ""Slight of build, perky of shot and with a scampish grin that got under a bowler's skin, by the time Root was appointed Test captain he had rattled up 53 Tests within five years with an average top side of 50, comfortably the highest among contemporary England players. Early expectations that he would establish himself as an opener did not materialise as an expansive game increasingly seemed better suited to No. 3 or No. 4. He was equally influential in limited-overs cricket where England's commitment to fearless cricket after their 2015 World Cup was much to his tastes, his crispness of stroke and shrewd judgment enabling him to bat purposefully around batsmen of greater weight of shot."", ""Root had never been a strikingly heavy scorer as he worked through the ranks, nor was he particularly athletic, but his systematic approach was that of a young batsman who would not sell his wicket easily and gave England hope that he would be able to attune his game to the highest level. A slender batsman reliant on precision, his patience and stubbornness at the crease had Geoffrey Boycott gushing that he reminded him of himself, although Root soon developed a much broader range. Others saw some of his mentor Michael Vaughan in Root's front-foot drive - the pair also both attended Sheffield Collegiate."", ""Root's Test debut for England in Nagpur in 2012 exemplified the qualities which had attracted coaches from an early age. Picked to tour India on the strength of two encouraging seasons with Yorkshire - and having been named Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year - he impressed enough to be selected for the final Test of the series. He began with England's sixth-longest debut innings in terms of balls faced, scoring 73 from 229 balls as he displayed the patience and discrimination demanded both by the situation of the game and a desperately slow surface. "", ""His rise continued with a maiden Test hundred in his home ground, Headingley, against New Zealand in 2013 followed by a maiden Ashes century at Lord's having been promoted to open. Root looked set to occupy that role for many years to come, but his fortunes dipped as the series went on and then crashed along with the team as England were whitewashed in Australia in 2013-14. He began the tour at No. 6, moved up to No. 3 after the enforced departure of Jonathan Trott, then saw his Ashes ended early when he was dropped for the fifth Test in Sydney."", ""Proof of Root's ability came in the way he responded. Back in England, he followed up a two-tone double hundred against Sri Lanka at Lord's - a disciplined innings with a freewheeling finale - with two more big hundreds against India. All three had the not-out asterisk. That seemed to say a lot about him."", 'He even had the fortune to skipper Yorkshire to the Championship title at Trent Bridge in 2014 when Andrew Gale was suspended, less than a fortnight after he became the first Yorkshire batsman to hit an ODI hundred at Headingley, with India the victims. He was also in charge for Yorkshire\'s thumping defeat at Middlesex, in which they chased down 472 in the fourth innings. To his amusement, his team-mates dubbed him ""Craptain"". ', ""His full potential then poured forth in 2015 when he made 1385 Test runs in the year, and vied with Australia's Steven Smith at the top of the ICC Test rankings. Root played with alacrity on all surfaces and in all formats and his obvious delight in his art was a positive symbol in an England side committed in all formats to a more enterprising approach. Jaunty Ashes hundreds at Cardiff and Nottingham helped England to victories, his consistency at No. 4 repeatedly masked top-order frailties, and a mischievous sense of humour made his success all the more pleasurable."", 'As England fell to defeat against Pakistan in the UAE in late 2015, a pattern began to build up which piqued Root even as he confirmed himself as one of the best batsmen around: his world became rather too full of entertaining 70s and 80s when he felt that a big hundred was there for the taking. Between his hundred in Johannesburg in early 2016 on a triumphant England tour and a century in Rajkot as England slumped 4-0 to India, he passed 50 six times but only converted one into a hundred. There again, it was quite a hundred: a career-best 254 against Pakistan at Old Trafford that banished talk of premature burnout in a non-stop England programme.', 'Firmly established among the modern game\'s ""Big Four"" batsmen (Root, Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson), these were years of easy scoring. In 2015 and 2016 he set consecutive records for runs accumulated across all formats in a calendar year for England, with 2228 and 2570 respectively; in 2017, he came within five runs of surpassing Vaughan\'s calendar high-water mark of 1481 for England in Tests, which had stood since 2002. The following summer, with back-to-back efforts against India, Root surpassed Marcus Trescothick\'s English record of 12 ODI hundreds.', ""Problems of conversion returned to afflict him in his second year as Test captain, however. Having made a matchwinning 190 against South Africa at Lord's, in his first match in charge, and a century in England's first day-night Test, against West Indies at Edgbaston, he went more than a year before again reaching three figures in a Test.

Roland-Jones dismissed Dean Elgar, Heino Kuhn, Quinton de Kock and, the best of the lot, Hashim Amla, who had made 311 not out in his last Test on this ground, and who was beaten by a leaping delivery. Roland-Jones went on to take five wickets in the innings and eight in the match, the best start to an England bowler's Test career since  2003 when James Kirtley took 8 for 113 against South Africa.. \n"", 'Roland-Jones took 17 wickets at 19.64 in his maiden Test summer, his four Tests showcasing the virtues he had long shown on the county circuit. There were no explosive changes of pace, or showy deliveries, just persistence around off stump around 82/83mph and the ability to move the ball. Some suspected he was an English specialist, but an Ashes tour was assured, only for him to lose the opportunity when he pulled up during a Championship match against Lancashire and was diagnosed with a stress fracture to his lower back with only a week of the season remaining. Even worse followed with a failed comeback for Middlesex early in 2018 which ruled him out of the rest of the season.', ""Roland-Jones claimed his place in the annals of Middlesex CCC when his hat-trick against Yorkshire at Lord's completed a Middlesex victory in the last session of the 2016 season and brought them their first Championship for 23 years.  When Middlesex had last won the title, Angus Fraser, their director of cricket, was a redoubtable seam bowler of similar style, making Roland-Jones' intervention a perfect climax."", ""Roland-Jones  is a tall, strong seam bowler who hails from Ashford in Middlesex. He has a repeatable action and can maintain good economy over long spells at speeds approaching the mid-80s. It was enough, at 28, to attract England's call-up to the squad ahead of the Lord's Test against Pakistan, although he failed to win a place in the final X1, so denying England its first double-barrelled cricketer since Norman 'Mandy' Mitchell-Innes, who made a single Test appearance, against South Africa in 1935."", ""After failing to win a contract with Surrey, who he represented in second eleven cricket, Roland-Jones crossed the river to take 36 first-class wickets at 19.11 in his debut season for Middlesex in 2010. His potential had been spotted by Fraser whilst playing for Leeds & Bradford University in the Universities final at Lord's the previous year. By the start of 2014, he was considered to be an outsider for England selection and won Lions recognition. His struggled a little in 2014, but against Northamptonshire in May, Roland-Jones produced an impressive performance: he took a career best 6-55 in the first innings, promptly eclipsed it with 6-50 in the second, and thumped 60 off 30 balls for good measure."", ""A maiden Championship hundred in 2015 was also quite something. Roland-Jones observed Yorkshire's deserved status as newly-crowned county champions and treated it with unexpected disdain as he summoned a freewheeling first-class century which belied his position at No. 10 in Middlesex's batting order.  "", 'Yorkshire clearly inspired him to the heights. It was a quickfire 79 and three wickets in the second innings to help Middlesex to victory over Yorkshire that brought him his maiden call-up to England\'s Test squad for the first Test against Pakistan in July 2016. He finished 2016 with 54 wickets, following 48 and 43 in the previous two seasons, figures which hardly screamed to England ""pick me"" but which began to get him talked about as a Test contender and which, combined with his dangerous lower middle-order hitting, were proof of his immense usefulness to his county.\n', '\n', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2010'],4.0,6,2,82,25,20.5,118,69.49,0,0,10,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,1,37,37*,-,37,100,0,0,5,1,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,102.0,141,26,2488,103*,21.63,4241,58.66,1,9,312,42,30.0,0.0,71.0,42,13,553,65,19.06,612,90.35,0,1,42,15,12.0,0.0,40.0,24,10,196,30,14,150,130.66,0,0,15,7,8.0,0.0,4.0,8,536,334,17,May-57,8/129,19.64,3.73,31.5,0,1,0,1.0,1,42,34,1,Jan-34,Jan-34,34,4.85,42,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,102.0,176,17624,9343,366,Jun-50,12/105,25.52,3.18,48.1,19,16,3,71.0,70,3230,2745,113,04-Oct,04-Oct,24.29,5.09,28.5,4,0,0,40.0,39,800,1171,45,Apr-25,Apr-25,26.02,8.78,17.7,2,0,0

Adil Rashid's Championship debut two years later - another landmark for Yorkshire players of Pakistani stock - attracted more attention, but between them Shahzad and Rashid changed the perceptions of a county which had finally broadened its commitment and appeal. \n"", 'A right-arm fast bowler and useful late middle-order batsman, Shahzad was a natural to break the mould. He had a sparky and strong-minded personality to go along with his talent and won plaudits for his displays at schoolboy level and for Yorkshire\'s Academy. Graham Roope, his school coach, said that he was ""far too mature for most schoolboy opponents of his age, and he can bat very well in addition to being a fearsome bowler."" ', ""He was also a rare example of an English street cricketer, much in the Pakistan tradition. The neighbour's wall that he used to play cricket against turned out to house the president of Windhill CC in the Bradford League. He was invited to nets as a consequence - proof, if any more was needed, of the natural talent available to English cricket if horizons are broadened."", ""He endured a couple of slow seasons at Yorkshire as injuries restricted his development, and he managed only a solitary appearance in 2006, but having changed his action to avoid a repetition of his stress fracture and finally allied consistency to his undoubted talent, he was given a first-team chance following the promotion of Tim Bresnan to the national squad. He claimed 40 wickets and scored 445 runs for Yorkshire in their 2009 Championship campaign, and was subsequently named in England's Test squad for their tour to Bangladesh in February 2010, much to the player's own surprise.  England saw pace, an ability to reverse swing the ball on dry surfaces and plentiful ambition."", 'The decisive factor in his call-up was an impressive stint with the England Performance Programme in South Africa a few months earlier, when he caught the eye of the senior management, including Andy Flower. With England opting to rest Stuart Broad for the home series against Bangladesh, Shahzad made his debut in the second Test at Old Trafford. ""He looks like an impressive young man,"" said Flower, ""and how well he does will be determined by himself."" ', 'That, though, marked a peak for Shahzad. Although he made occasional one-day international appearances - and was a reserve quick on the 2010-11 Ashes tour, seriously considered but ultimately not selected in Adelaide - he could not command a regular place in the side and drifted out of contention after the 2011 World Cup through a mixture of form and injury. Domestically, life also became difficult. He was released by Yorkshire - who cited issues with his team spirit - and was taken on loan by Lancashire for the rest of 2012 season. When Lancashire were relegated that summer, and wavwered over whether to offer him a full-time deal, he opted to move to Nottinghamshire in an attempt to revive his career.', 'Eight months on, Shahzad had asked enough questions of himself to conclude that his Yorkshire departure was a divorce with faults on both sides. But while he accepted he was ""stubborn"" in the way he resisted Yorkshire\'s attempts to curb his natural instincts as a bowler, he was far from repentant, insisting that he remained an attacking bowler best suited to chasing wickets by intimidating batsmen with short, sharp bursts and plentiful yorkers and skiddy bouncers. A holding role was not for him.', 'Only 22 Championship wickets at nearly 50 in 2013 did nothing to support his conviction that he knew his own strengths.  He also admitted to being ""infuriated"" when he was told he would miss out in the YB40 final at Lord\'s because Stuart Broad, Notts\' England quick, was available for the final. But Jake Ball, Notts\' hero of the semifinal, succumbed to injury and Shahzad was spared. Three wickets in the YB final at Lord\'s as Nottinghamshire beat Glamorgan finally gave him something to smile about. Notts\' appointment of Andy Pick as their bowling coach ahead of the 2014 season gave Shahzad another chance to find the mentor he so desperately needed.', ""Instead, he prospered more in one-day cricket than the four-day game and Sussex became his fourth county in slightly more than two years as he looked to Mark Robinson, the county's coach, to resurrect an England career, that at 28, many presumed to be behind him. A career-best five-for in early season against Worcestershire suggested Sussex could rehabilitate him, as they had done others, but injury limited him to only five Championship games."", ""The move did not go entirely to plan with Shahzad's form and fitness patchy.

Following Michael Vaughan\'s return home due to injury early in the tour, Shah was drafted in as a replacement and made a composed and vital 88 in a memorable victory. A stylish and classical batsman who seemed to have the world at his feet as a teenager, he was compared in ability to the young Mark Ramprakash. Shah made his first-class debut in 1996, and at the end of the promising summer, Wisden praised his ""abundant promise"". His county cap followed, but back-to-back seasons with averages in the mid 20s ended with him being dropped by Middlesex in 2000.  \n', ""He bounced back in 2001 in fine form, and was drafted into England's one-day side in the NatWest Series where he looked at ease, especially when making 62 against Pakistan at Lord's. Even though he toured as part of England's one-day squad to Zimbabwe and New Zealand that winter, his chances were limited. He was overlooked in 2002, but again played a few one-dayers the following winter in the ICC Knock-out Trophy and in the VB Series, but he found it almost impossible to forge a place in the side.  Another solid season followed, but others edged ahead of him in the pecking order, and there was talk that his fielding was not helping his cause. His international ambitions suffered a further blow when he was relieved of the vice-captaincy at Middlesex in June 2004 after a string of bad results. However, a feast of runs in 2005 (1728 runs at a healthy average of 66.46) led to his inclusion in the England A tour of the Caribbean in 2006, and ultimately his Test debut. Further opportunities were thin on the ground, however. He had to wait 18 months for his second Test - another one-off appearance, this time at Lord's against West Indies where he failed twice - but a series of eyecatching performances followed in the one-day series, as England rebuilt after another disappointing World Cup campaign. Despite the continued failings of England's top 6, he was but a spectator and drinks carrier for the Test tours of Sri Lanka and New Zealand."", ""Good county form and half-centuries in the home ODIs against New Zealand ensured he travelled to India at the end of 2008, and he finally got his opportunity in the Caribbean the following spring, following the selectors' temporary loss of patience with Ian Bell. An anxious Shah failed to cement his position, however, with his uncertain running-between-the-wickets proving his downfall, and he was overlooked for the subsequent home summer as Ravi Bopara leapt into the No. 3 position."", ""Though he remained a key figure in the one-day set-up, he was surprisingly axed for the tour of South Africa in 2009-10, despite a memorable 98 from 89 balls in the Champions Trophy that preceded it. As England settled on a formula that delivered both Twenty20 and one-day success it appeared as though Shah's international career was over and he was dealt a further blow when he was unceremoniously released by Middlesex at the end of the 2010 season and signed for Essex, although his debut was delayed by the IPL. Decent returns in 2011 and 2012 saw him retained by Essex on a further one-year deal but Shah was an increasingly itinerant cricketer, taking in stints in Australia's Big Bash and the Bangladesh Premier League as he moved towards a career as a T20 specialist.

When it is a young legspinner the hype is magnified. When it is a young spinner of Pakistani extraction, brought up in Yorkshire, the sense of excitement becomes palpable. Adil Rashid, the player who above all symbolized Yorkshire's growing success in fostering strong relationships in its minority ethnic communities, burst onto the scene with six wickets against Warwickshire on his first-class debut in 2006 at Scarborough. There was a sense in Yorkshire's much-loved seaside town that afternoon as Rashid cut through Warwickshire that a historic breakthrough had been made and more than one Yorkshire supporter observed Rashid's performance with hearts uplifted. \n"", 'A decade later, as he left a tour of India in which England had been trounced 4-0, it was still occasionally possible to see the vulnerable, taciturn 18-year-old of whom Yorkshire were so protective. Rashid had 10 Test caps, all of them in the UAE or South Asia where England needed a second spinner, but even on such surfaces he needed careful handling in case his leg spin succumbed under the pressure. He seemed happiest in limited-overs cricket where the game unfolded in a more predictable fashion and he knew that batsmen would be committed to attack. It was hard to imagine him as a single spinner in England unless he became more serviceable, but such had been remarked of countless legspinners before him.', ""A five-wicket haul on debut against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi after a return of 0 for plenty in the first innings augured well (setting up a short run chase which England narrowly failed to achieve) and he also brushed up well a year later in Dhaka at the start of England's 2016-17 tour of Bangladesh and India. His India series gradually took a turn for the worse, however, the promise of Rajkot and Visakhapatnam giving way to a more pessimistic air - and some hefty figures in the runs column - in Mumbai and Chennai. He had the ability to hoover up a tail at both England and county level; sometimes the problem was getting to it."", ""In the limited-overs formats, Rashid was a vital component of England's attack and a first-class average with the bat in the mid-30s told of a player who would not have been consigned to the tail in many England XIs in the past."", ""Rashid's also caught the eye early in his career for England Under-19s nd an eight-wicket haul during the second Test against India. But he suffered a stress fracture in his back in the close season which forced him to remodel his action. His profile rose further in 2007 when he struck his maiden Championship century against Worcestershire in August and at the end of the season the Cricket Writers' Club made him their Young Cricketer of the Year. In 2008 he enjoyed his most prolific season with 62 wickets in the County Championship and was a late addition to the squad for the Test series in India. That trip was purely for experience, however, as was the tour to West Indies which followed, but even so his career shone with potential."", 'Rashid responded the following season with 545 runs at 68.12, including two hundreds, and picked up 31 wickets at 36.06 in the 2009 first-class season. His statistics in one-day and Twenty20 cricket were more modest, but the selectors held faith in his potential, and he made his England debut during the World Twenty in June of that year. He also played in the post-Ashes one-day series against Australia, but his most notable achievement came with the bat when he scored a quickfire 31 in a narrow defeat at The Oval.', 'Rashid was included in the party to tour South Africa in 2009-10, but had a difficult time on the trip. He began amid high hopes that his combination of legspin and promising lower-order batting could cement a permanent role in the side, but his solitary over in the second Twenty20 went for 25, then he bowled three overs for 27 in the second ODI before being left out for a fit-again Graeme Swann. When he was released from the one-day party, James Tredwell, the Kent offspinner, remained on stand-by which suggested Rashid had fallen down the pecking order. ', ""Andy Flower, England's coach, rightly suggested that he would benefit from a chance to deepen his game at county level, but progress was not immediate. Yorkshire, by now, were showing signs of disquiet over Rashid's bowling. England had demanded that he bowled much quicker and his confidence and method had deserted him when he returned from international duty. His county form faltered, although he did win a place in the England Lions squad to tour UAE and was called-up briefly for the end of the World Cup campaign."", 'At home, Rashid enjoyed his most productive season for Yorkshire in 2010, scoring 732 first-class runs at 45.75 and taking 57 wickets at 31.29. He began the 2011 season with a bang, taking 6 for 77 and 5 for 37 to secure victory against Worcestershire at New Road, the best figures for a leg-spinner in Yorkshire history, but failed to maintain his form, finishing the season with 39 wickets at 43.38. From 10 Championship matches in 2012 he totalled only 16 wickets and 129 runs and his discontent was apparent. ', ""Rashid was at a crossroads. But more than 800 Championship runs at 50-plus in 2013 suggested that in his mid-20s not just his batting was maturing, and his bowling became more thoughtful, and dangerous in turn with a good googly particularly evident. Yorkshire's challenge was to bring his career to fruition, to bring him not just success on the field but a general contentment. A career that had begun with so much optimism began to reawaken England's interest again - cagily at first with a Lions recall - as Yorkshire won the title in 2014. The appointment of Trevor Bayliss as coach coincided with his return to the England side for the first time in nearly six years, a string of limited-overs displays being joined by limited success in his first three Tests, against Pakistan on the slow, big turners of the UAE."", 'He was a much-loved figure on Yorkshire grounds, contributing to back-to-back Championships in 2014 and 15, and dubbed ""The Hoover"" by the head coach Jason Gillespie. But his request to rest out a title decider against Middlesex at Lord\'s the following year - he later explained that his grandmother was unwell - exasperated his captain, Andrew Gale. Gale\'s appointment as Yorkshire\'s coach at the end of the season suggested that conversation was not entirely finished.', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2006, 2007, 2008', ""Cricket Writers' Club 2007 Young Cricketer of the Year""]",19.0,33,5,540,61,19.28,1270,42.51,0,2,62,4,4.0,0.0,83.0,36,9,529,69,19.59,526,100.57,0,1,59,6,25.0,0.0,36.0,14,8,47,9*,7.83,55,85.45,0,0,4,0,10.0,0.0,175.0,251,41,6822,180,32.48,,,10,37,,,79.0,0.0,198.0,116,33,1626,71,19.59,1802,90.23,0,2,148,16,63.0,0.0,163.0,85,32,682,36*,12.86,648,105.24,0,0,49,11,47.0,0.0,19.0,34,3816,2390,60,May-49,7/178,39.83,3.75,63.6,5,2,0,83.0,77,4090,3807,128,May-27,May-27,29.74,5.58,31.9,7,2,0,36.0,34,708,863,36,03-Nov,03-Nov,23.97,7.31,19.6,0,0,0,175.0,287,29901,17949,512,7/107,11/114,35.05,3.6,58.4,28,20,1,198.0,186,9063,8177,272,May-27,May-27,30.06,5.41,33.3,10,3,0,163.0,157,3321,4086,186,Apr-19,Apr-19,21.96,7.38,17.8,5,0,0

On his second XI debut for Warwickshire in 2002, effectively a trial game, Jonathan Trott scored a dominant 245 that suggested the arrival of a special talent. It was, after all, the highest score by a debutant in the history of Second XI Championship cricket and convinced Warwickshire to sign Trott, unlike Kevin Pietersen in a similar situation three years earlier. But not Trott. He smashed his bat in frustration after his dismissal. This was a man whose hunger for runs would not be easily sated. \n', ""Starting well was a theme of Trott's career. In 2003 he made a century on first-class debut as an opener for Warwickshire against a strong Sussex attack - he was 96 not out at lunch - and in 2009 he made a century on Test debut at The Oval. To have played such a significant part in England winning an Ashes decider earned his reputation as a technically correct, temperamentally sound top-order batsman. Though less glorious tours of South Africa and Bangladesh followed, Trott sealed his reputation with a double-century against Bangladesh at Lord's and a masterful 184 against a Pakistan side at the same ground. Though the match was later tarnished by spot-fixing revelations, Trott later said he considered the innings his best as he defied Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif and helped rescue England from 102 for 7."", ""Trott went on to play a key part in England retaining the Ashes in Australia in 2010-11 - the first time they had won a Test series there in nearly a quarter of a century - with centuries at Adelaide and Melbourne and the defeat of India in England the following summer to assume the No.1 Test ranking. His standing as the finest No. 3 England had possessed for many years was confirmed. Despite a relatively lean 2012, during which he averaged 38.65, Trott's remarkable consistency was demonstrated by a run at the start of the following year, when his lowest score in 17 consecutive Test and ODI innings was 27, with two hundreds and six half-centuries."", 'Born in Cape Town to a British father and South African mother, Trott played for the South Africa side from Under-15 to Under-19 level, graduating into the Boland and then the Western Province teams. His future in the South Africa side looked assured. But Trott, never easily satisfied, wanted more. Bored by further education - he admits he had to look at the blackboard to even spell the subject during the psychology portion of his exam in the Human Movement Science degree he abandoned at Stellenbosch University - he took advantage of his British passport and his relationship with Bob Woolmer, who coached South Africa and Warwickshire, to arrange a trail in England. He soon embraced the club and country with a passion, marrying the granddaughter of former club captain HE ""Tom"" Dollery and insisting he felt ""completely British"" and that he preferred Birmingham to Cape Town.', ""There have been some downs amid the ups. In 2007, in the middle of Mark Greatbatch's unhappy period as director of cricket at Edgbaston, Trott endured a chronic loss of form that saw him average only 22 and Warwickshire suffer relegation in both first-class and List A formats. Oddly, he made his international debut that season having been called into the England T20I team. After breaking his hand in the nets prior to the match, it was one of the few times he made an underwhelming debut. "", ""Despite setting a record in 2009 for the most runs in an English domestic T20 season of 10 matches, some have never accepted his value as a limited-overs player, either. While Trott's ODI average in excess of 50 is substantially higher than any regular England player in ODI history, his strike-rate of around 75 was a source of constant discussion - never more so than during the 2013 Champions Trophy, when the make-up of England's top three was questioned. The records showed, however, that when Trott flourishes, England flourished too, and he was their leading run-scorer as they narrowly failed to win the competition."", 'His presence at the crease had arguably become the most reassuring sight in English cricket since the retirement of Graham Gooch. His prolonged marking of his guard was as near as cricket got to a national talking point. But when he abruptly left England\'s 2012-13 Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane with a stress-related illness, England\'s director of cricket, Andy Flower, bemoaned the loss of his ""rock"".', 'An early attempt at a comeback at the start of the 2014 season had to be aborted after it transpired there would be no quick fix to his problems and a discomfort against the short ball became more apparent. But, after a break, he returned strongly towards the end of the season, ending the Royal London One-Day campaign as the highest England-qualified run-scorer and helping Warwickshire to second place in the Championship. It was enough to win him a recall to the Lions squad for the tour of South Africa and, following a double-century there, a Test recall in the Caribbean.', 'Asked to open the batting, he reached double-figures only once in six innings and suffered three ducks as it became apparent that he was still troubled by anxiety problems. It was no surprise when he announced his retirement from international cricket at the end of the tour. He played on for Warwickshire until 2018, a consummate team man. His final summer was relaxed and productive, helped by his early announcement of his intention to retire. As it wound down, there was even a double century stand with Ian Bell against Kent to encourage nostalgia. ""There are only so many runs you can score,"" he said when it was all over.\n', '\n']",[],52.0,93,6,3835,226,44.08,8128,47.18,9,19,451,0,29.0,0.0,68.0,65,10,2819,137,51.25,3658,77.06,4,22,216,3,14.0,0.0,7.0,7,1,138,51,23,144,95.83,0,1,9,3,0.0,0.0,281.0,468,47,18662,226,44.32,,,46,92,,,223.0,0.0,274.0,253,44,10056,137,48.11,,,23,67,,,77.0,0.0,81.0,76,16,2147,86*,35.78,1870,114.81,0,13,219,34,18.0,0.0,52.0,33,708,400,5,01-May,01-May,80,3.38,141.6,0,0,0,68.0,10,183,166,2,Feb-31,Feb-31,83,5.44,91.5,0,0,0,7.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,281.0,,6206,3487,70,Jul-39,,49.81,3.37,88.6,,1,0,274.0,,1788,1700,58,Apr-55,Apr-55,29.31,5.7,30.8,2,0,0,81.0,11,144,234,8,Feb-19,Feb-19,29.25,9.75,18,0,0,0

6 ft 3 in ",,Opening batsman,Left-hand bat,Right-arm medium,,,,"['\nA brutal left-handed opening batsman, Marcus Trescothick was one of the finest opening batsmen to play for England and also stood in as captain for two Tests and 10 ODIs.  He was an automatic choice from the turn of the century until a stress-related illness intervened with him not much past his 30th birthday and forced his international retirement in 2008. The anxiety attacks he suffered, particularly when having to contend with long periods away from home and family, brought the issue of depression and stress in sport into sharp focus in the English game and there was general delight when he continued his county career at Somerset where his genial biffing of county attacks brought much entertainment at Taunton and elsewhere. Somerset sought his services beyond his 40th birthday, confirming him as one of the great stalwarts of the English game in any era. \n', ""Capacious of build and comfortable of movement, he had a benign air at the crease which meant that when he bullied attacks, which he did often, he bullied them gently. Not particularly mobile in the field, he turned himself into a safe slip fielder. He was a key factor in England's change in fortunes and, most notably, spearheaded an aggressive approach against Australia in the Ashes win of 2005. "", ""There was something biblical about Trescothick's early career: seven years of plenty as a schoolboy, seven years of famine when he reached the Somerset 1st XI. And lo, it came to pass in 1999 that he batted on a pacey pitch at Taunton against Glamorgan while Duncan Fletcher was their coach, and made a storming 167, with five sixes, when the next-best score was 50. When England needed a stand-in one-day opener in 2000, Fletcher, by then elevated to the England job, remembered Trescothick. He took to international cricket immediately. A true opener, he formed a habit of starting a series well with a mixture of expert leaves, crisp cover-drives, spanking pulls and fearless slog-sweeps."", ""Hefty, genial, and at ease on the big stage, Trescothick's first four England hundreds came in a losing cause, confirming his ability to keep his head while all around were losing theirs. Opening in Tests with Mike Atherton, Trescothick acquired the air of a senior player as if by osmosis - he joined the management committee on his first tour. All that stood between him and the highest level was a tendency to get out when well set, to make a breezy 20 or 30. He seemed to have conquered this with a domineering home season in 2002, but it reappeared - like so many English frailties - as soon as the team landed in Australia. Trescothick endured fluctuating fortunes over the next couple of seasons. He showed glimpses of his blazing best against South Africa in 2003, when he capped his season with a determined 219 (and 69 not out) in the astonishing series-levelling victory at The Oval, but his form slid away drastically in the Caribbean that winter."", ""The selectors never lost faith with him and, having stood in as captain for the first Test of the 2004 season, Trescothick cracked a pair of hundreds against West Indies at Edgbaston. At Johannesburg in 2004-05, he set up England's series victory with a brutal 180 on the final morning, and carried his domineering form into the home season. Having bullied 345 runs in two innings against the Bangladeshis, he made 431 runs against Australia in a memorable summer of 2005, as he - and England - finally got the better of the one nation that really mattered. He cracked 90 in the second Test at Edgbaston, underlining that this England side was not lying down. It ignited the summer, a hope-laden innings from a player who was widely praised as the most selfless of cricketers."", 'But his winter was cut short when he returned home suddenly from India under a cloak of secrecy, and after an indifferent summer it was announced he would miss the Champions Trophy as he was still recovering from a stress-related illness. He was included in the Ashes squad for the 2006-07 campaign Down Under but lasted less than two weeks before he was again boarding a flight back home with a recurrence of his illness.', ""His return to action started with Somerset and his 2007 form, plus England's continued failings in one-day cricket, meant he was recalled to England's preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup. But he never made the cut, and, in March 2008, days after withdrawing at the last minute from Somerset's pre-season tour to the UAE - he was in an outlet of Dixons, the electrical store, when he decided he could not board the plane - he announced his retirement from international cricket. His candid autobiography, "", "", was published in 2008, and told of his battle with the 'black wings' of depression."", ""The book had a cathartic effect. In 2009 he enjoyed one of his most prolific seasons yet, scoring nearly 3,000 runs for Somerset in all competitions. He was named captain following Justin Langer's decision not to return for 2010 and even overcame his reservations to take part in the county's Champions League campaign in India that October, although he flew home after the group stages."", ""Already enshrined in Somerset folklore, with a stand named in his honour, he nearly delivered the ultimate prize in 2010. His 1,397 runs at 58.20 helped Somerset enter the final day of the season knowing victory at Durham would be enough to win them their maiden County Championship. But time ran out on Somerset and Nottinghamshire achieved the bonus point they needed with three wickets after tea to snatch the title. Seemingly getting better with age, Trescothick plundered 1,673 runs in 2011 at a career-best season's average of 79.66. He also led Somerset to the finals of both the Friends Life t20 and Cyldesdale Bank 40, only to lose both. A year later, injury and poor weather resulted in a less-than-prolific season but, undeterred by his advancing years, Trescothick signed a new three year deal with Somerset in November 2012 but failed to score a century in any competition in 2013 - the first time in his career he has gone through a season without a three figure score. He recovered, in the first-class game at least, rattling up a formidable 1284 runs at 45.86 to help offset Somerset's relegation fears in 2015, including 210 not out in a vital late-season draw against Sussex at Hove."", ""He must have felt as he passed his 40th birthday on Christmas Day that his chances of leading Somerset to that elusive Championship title had diminished. But he could not have imagined the agonising miss that befell Somerset in 2016 when they wrapped up a win in their final game at Taunton with a day to spare, went top of the table, but watched Middlesex and Yorkshire - both with title aspirations of their own - manufacture a positive result at Lord's. Trescothick had a wonderful personal season to look back on: 1,239 Championship runs and four more hundreds, capped by 218 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, an innings made on a stonkingly hot day which took him alongside Harold Gimblett as Somerset's most prolific century-maker in first-class cricket. He entered 2017 amid hopes in the West Country that the record would come his way at Taunton with the Quantocks shimmering in the haze and the chance to raise a glass to it with a post-match cider in the Ring of Bells. It duly arrived in May, bringing delight to an otherwise drab rain-affected draw against Warwickshire."", 'By now, uncertainty over whether Trescothick would play on had become an annual ritual. In 2018, he broke his foot while turning awkwardly when batting against Lancashire at Old Trafford (on 95, he hobbled to a century), but retained the desire to recover before the end of the season andagree another year at his beloved Taunton.', '\n']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 1996,1997', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2005', 'Awarded the MBE in 2005']",76.0,143,10,5825,219,43.79,10685,54.51,14,29,831,42,95.0,0.0,123.0,122,6,4335,137,37.37,5087,85.21,12,21,528,41,49.0,0.0,3.0,3,0,166,72,55.33,131,126.71,0,2,23,1,2.0,0.0,385.0,665,36,26089,284,41.47,,,66,127,,,550.0,0.0,372.0,357,29,12229,184,37.28,,,28,63,,,149.0,0.0,89.0,87,5,2363,108*,28.81,1569,150.6,2,17,304,80,29.0,0.0,76.0,10,300,155,1,Jan-34,Jan-34,155,3.1,300,0,0,0,123.0,13,232,219,4,02-Jul,02-Jul,54.75,5.66,58,0,0,0,3.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,385.0,,2704,1551,36,Apr-36,,43.08,3.44,75.1,,0,0,372.0,,2010,1644,57,Apr-50,Apr-50,28.84,4.9,35.2,1,0,0,89.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

His body gave him all the ingredients - pace, bounce and accuracy - to be a world-class fast bowler apart from one: a lack of resilience which curtailed what might have been an outstanding Test career. Instead, England will be primarily grateful for memories of the 2010-11 Ashes series when he was a key part of their series victory in Australia. \n', 'It was apt that Tremlett announced his retirement in 2015 after conceding that his body could not stand the rigours of professional cricket any longer. He cut a gentle, passive figure for a fast bowler, which made him an easy target as the injuries mounted and his impact could never be relied upon, with some suspecting that he wilted under pressure, but a lesser figurer would also have abandoned hope much earlier. ', ""Tremlett played 12 Tests, 15 ODIs and one T20 for England. He made his Test debut against India, at Lord's, in 2007 and bowled impressively in his first series but the twin devils of injury and inconsistency ensured he did not play another Test until the tour of Australia in 2010-11."", 'His recall in Perth marked the beginning of his most successful spell as an international bowler as he collected 17 wickets in three matches to help England win down under for the first time in 24 years. He took 17 wickets at 23.35, which included the Ashes-winning wicket and fleetingly became part of a strong pack of fast bowlers that led England to the top of the world rankings, following his Ashes success with 15 wickets in three Tests against Sri Lanka. That series led to comparisons with Joel Garner but, having broken into the top ten rankings, injury struck. ', ""Although he played a Test in UAE against Pakistan the following winter he was not fully fit and had surgery to remedy his back problems soon after. Many believed that would be the end of his international career but he returned to play three more Tests over the subsequent three years - one apiece against India, Sri Lanka and his final appearance against Australia, at Brisbane, in late 2013. The latter was the first Test of England's unhappy Ashes tour in 2013-14, when he passed 50 Test wickets more than six years after his debut. He was a bad, theoretical pick - England's desire for a physically threatening pace attack, and respect for his Ashes record on the previous tour of Australia, flying in the face of his mediocre county form for Surrey. England, oddly, were reported to be shocked by his pace which rarely touched 80mph - 10mph or so down on his previous trip to Australia."", 'His ODI debut had come two years before his Test bow and he claimed four wickets in his first appearance against Bangladesh in 2005. However, another 14 matches spread over seven years brought just 11 further scalps.', 'Across a 146-match first-class career for Hampshire and Surrey, he claimed 459 wickets at 28.66 with a career-best of 8 for 96. He also took 180 List A wickets and 75 in T20.', ""Tremlett came from an esteemed cricketing family: son of Tim Tremlett, the former Hampshire seamer, and the grandson of Maurice, who played for Somerset and England in the 1940s and 50s. He took a wicket with his first ball of first-class cricket, against New Zealand A in 2000 and after impressing for Hampshire made the England Under-19 tour of India in 2000-01, and a place in the first batch of Rod Marsh's academy intakes in 2001-02."", ""An impressive start to the 2004 season with Hampshire earned him a call up to England's preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy, and the following year he was named in England's new 25-man development squad, ahead of the 2005 Ashes. He made his one-day debut during the 2005 NatWest Series - and was denied a hat-trick against Bangladesh only because the ball bounced off middle stump without dislodging the bails. Despite his domestic performances tailing off in the second half of the 2005 season and a suspicion that he tended to lose rhythm under pressure, Tremlett earned a call-up to the England squad for Pakistan before a hamstring injury ruled him out. It set the precedent for his international career. "", ""After much injury disruption, he was handed his Test debut against India at Lord's. Troubling the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up with uncomfortable bounce and lively pace, he looked set to be a key man as England looked to forge a new attack after the 2005 generation. Instead injury struck once more."", ""After missing the 2007-08 winter tours he was included in England's ODI squad to face Scotland but a heel injury ended his hopes. After a frustrating 2009 season, where he played seven Championship matches, he left Hampshire for Surrey. It was a move that worked wonders - Surrey's large squad meant he did not have to play every game - and, after taking 48 Championship wickets, he earned a recall for the Ashes tour that established his reputation as a high-class quick."", 'There were still a few moments to remind everybody of his talent: five wickets in seven overs to inspire a turnaround victory against Gloucestershire in May 2014. His batting was also much improved as he came within ten runs of a maiden first-class hundred against Leicestershire, playing with a maturity and calmness his batting had previously lacked. His last first-class appearance came for Surrey against Glamorgan at Guildford in 2015 after which he took specialist advice to call time on his career. He was 34, a good age, but it was hard to escape the conclusion, however, that his retirement was clouded with thoughts of what might have been.', '\n', ' ']","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2000', 'NBC Denis Compton Award 2001']",12.0,15,4,113,25*,10.27,299,37.79,0,0,12,0,4.0,0.0,15.0,11,4,50,19*,7.14,89,56.17,0,0,2,2,4.0,0.0,1.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0.0,0.0,146.0,183,45,2462,90,17.84,,,0,10,,,38.0,0.0,133.0,83,27,563,38*,10.05,,,0,0,,,27.0,0.0,59.0,22,11,100,13,9.09,95,105.26,0,0,4,3,5.0,0.0,12.0,23,2902,1431,53,Jun-48,8/150,27,2.95,54.7,2,2,0,15.0,15,784,705,15,Apr-32,Apr-32,47,5.39,52.2,1,0,0,1.0,1,24,45,2,Feb-45,Feb-45,22.5,11.25,12,0,0,0,146.0,,25154,13158,459,Aug-96,,28.66,3.13,54.8,,13,0,133.0,,6129,5002,180,Apr-25,Apr-25,27.78,4.89,34,6,0,0,59.0,59,1187,1452,75,Apr-16,Apr-16,19.36,7.33,15.8,2,0,0

When he retired in 2018, having not played a game in his final summer, he had taken 830 wickets for Kent in 613 matches since making his debut in 2000 and also made a decent contribution to England in difficult times. \n"", ""He had racked up almost a decade of unswerving county service by the time England gave him the first of his 45 ODI caps, against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2010, and his offspin - bowled in a more old-fashioned, slower style than was the norm among many of his international contemporaries - has given England stout service. Such is Tredwell's unfashionable air that he was content to talk ahead of an England tour of his hobby making home-made jam and chutney, and imagined packing a couple of jars to help him through his latest overseas assignment.  In Kent in particular, they valued his gentle talents, backed up by excellent close catching and some useful lower-order batting.  As Vic Marks wrote in "", ': ""James Tredwell is not and never will be a superstar. He is the journeyman\'s journeyman and a fine antidote to the celebrity cricketer.""', ""\nIt was as a limited-overs cricketer that Tredwell also made most of his early appearances for Kent but by 2003 he was representing the county in both forms of the game on a regular basis. He captained the England Under-19s side and led Kent second XI to success in the Second XI Trophy final of 2002 when he scored 111. His obvious potential elevated him to a place in the ECB National Academy squad for 2003-04, where he found himself captaining the squad in difficult circumstances following the withdrawal of Alex Gidman. His performances earned him a call up to the England Performance Squad in the winter of 2007. He was subsequently rewarded with inclusion in England's one-day squad for their tour of New Zealand in 2008."", ""Tredwell didn't get a game on that tour, but steady performances with the England Lions and Kent, including a career-best 123 not out against a touring New Zealand side and 69 wickets in the County Championship in 2009 kept him in contention. He was called up as cover for Swann during England's tour to South Africa in 2009-10 and, although once again he did not feature in a starting XI, he was included in the Lions tour to UAE in February 2010. His consistent performances booked him a place in England's squad to tour Bangladesh in February and March 2010 and he finally made his debut in the second Test at Dhaka, taking six wickets in England's nine-wicket win.  He was one of four spinners chosen for England's tour of Sri Lanka in March 2012 and he played a part in the one-day series against Australia and South Africa that summer."", ""With Swann rested, he made his T20 international debut in India in December 2012 and then followed that up with 11 wickets in the ODIs that followed after Christmas. He was a very different character to the extrovert - and highly successful - Swann and, if he was unlikely ever to hit such heights, he made international cricket seem a polite place to be. His progress as an offspinner was steady rather than spectacular but he had a steady temperament and ability to vary his pace good habits can bring rewards and they started to come thick and fast. England's interest did not extend to Test cricket: he won his first of two caps against Bangladesh in Dhaka and, following Swann's sudden retirement during a Test whitewash in Australia in 2013-14, England looked elsewhere the following summer before giving him a second cap in Antigua in 2015."", ""Tredwell's was named Kent captain for 2013, following Rob Key's decision to stand down. But his form in first-class cricket had by then become less impressive than in the shorter formats and, under challenge from the tyro Adam Riley, he even accepted a loan spell at Sussex in 2014 in search of regular cricket before returning to Kent at the end of the season and settling back in with typical economy in the limited-overs formats."", 'England\'s disastrous World Cup campaign in Australia in 2015, though, ended his England career at 33. Peter Moores was sacked as coach, Trevor Bayliss took over and a new high-energy brand of cricket had no place for him. ""Sometimes a change of view means that some people are put on the rubbish tip,"" he said. When he fell out of favour with Kent in 2017, he sought discussions with other counties to try to attain regular cricket, but his career was nearing its end.', '\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2003'],2.0,2,0,45,37,22.5,87,51.72,0,0,6,0,2.0,0.0,45.0,25,11,163,30,11.64,242,67.35,0,0,9,4,14.0,0.0,17.0,6,3,32,22,10.66,20,160,0,0,4,1,2.0,0.0,177.0,247,31,4728,124,21.88,10768,43.9,4,17,,,196.0,0.0,270.0,174,63,1917,88,17.27,,,0,4,,,110.0,0.0,166.0,74,27,519,34*,11.04,489,106.13,0,0,47,8,48.0,0.0,2.0,4,786,321,11,Apr-47,6/181,29.18,2.45,71.4,2,0,0,45.0,44,2104,1666,60,Apr-41,Apr-41,27.76,4.75,35,3,0,0,17.0,15,317,416,7,Jan-16,Jan-16,59.42,7.87,45.2,0,0,0,177.0,,30574,15439,426,Aug-66,,36.24,3.02,71.7,21,12,3,270.0,,11606,9076,276,Jun-27,Jun-27,32.88,4.69,42,9,1,0,166.0,158,3242,3964,128,Apr-21,Apr-21,30.96,7.33,25.3,1,0,0

An early developer, he first hit the headlines in 2009 when, as a 15-year-old net bowler, his favourite player Kevin Pietersen drilled a drive into the side of his head. He needed stitches but Pietersen left him a signed bat as a more welcome memento.', ""It wasn't until 2011 that Topley started making his own headlines. As a gangly 17-year-old left-arm seamer with huge potential he took 14 wickets for Essex in his three opening Championship matches - including five-wicket hauls in each of his first two games against Kent and Middlesex."", 'That season was interrupted as Topley had to return to Royal Hospital School in Suffolk to start revising for the summer exams. His father, the former Essex player Don, was his school teacher and cricket mentor so slacking in any department is not an option. ', ""Topley seemed admirably unaffected by the early hype. At the Under-19 World Cup in Australia in 2012, he stood out as a professional in a boys' game: no one claimed more than his 19 wickets, which came at nine apiece, and Topley relished his status as a senior bowler in England's side. Further recognition - before he had even turned 19 - arrived with an England Lions call-up for the 2013 tour Down Under."", ""The ECB and Essex have been careful to manage his workload, the county rotating him with their other talented quicks. He was a key member of the team in 2013, taking more than 80 wickets in all formats to earn a place on England's Performance Programme trip to Australia. However, a back injury ruled him out of going to Sri Lanka with the Lions, a reminder of how young fast bowlers need protecting."", 'Topley had played for Essex representative sides since the age of nine, but immediately after his England debut in a T20I against Australia in 2015 he announced he was on his way. At 21, his childhood county lacked, in his eyes, the ambition to sustain him, comfortable with Division Two of the Championship and unable to turn its excellent wins ratio in the limited-overs game into trophies. Topley headed for Hampshire, whose success in the limited-overs game was undeniable. As a tall left-armer with an ability to swing the ball at a decent lick, his appeal was obvious.', ""But injury struck again, this time in more freakish fashion, in his first season with Hampshire. He failed to bowl a ball after being ruled out for the season during his debut when his left hand was broken when he was hit by a bouncer while batting against Warwickshire's Boyd Rankin. Shoulder surgery followed in the close season and then he suffered another back stress fracture in August 2017 in a season in which he had managed only 112 overs in all competitions. "", 'Topley signed a white-ball only deal in 2018 and won an England Lions call-up against India A as a show of faith, allowing him to show some neatly-timed form just ahead of the Royal London Cup final, but he was not selected, and soon needed a pin in his back after a fifth stress fracture. He signalled his wish to move on and was released in September.', '\n\n']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2011'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,5,4,7,6,7,40,17.5,0,0,0,0,2.0,0.0,6.0,1,1,1,1*,-,2,50,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,34.0,41,19,94,16,4.27,488,19.26,0,0,8,0,8.0,0.0,55.0,17,11,54,19,9,113,47.78,0,0,4,1,13.0,0.0,63.0,12,7,15,5*,3,30,50,0,0,2,0,16.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.0,10,463,410,16,Apr-50,Apr-50,25.62,5.31,28.9,1,0,0,6.0,6,103,173,5,Mar-24,Mar-24,34.6,10.07,20.6,0,0,0,34.0,59,5966,3401,127,Jun-29,Nov-85,26.77,3.42,46.9,3,7,2,55.0,55,2558,2366,93,Apr-16,Apr-16,25.44,5.54,27.5,9,0,0,63.0,62,1323,1827,84,Apr-26,Apr-26,21.75,8.28,15.7,2,0,0

Taylor had played a full part in England's 2015-16 Test series win in South Africa but just a few months later, in the opening week of the County Championship, he was forced to retire with immediate effect due to ARVC (Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy), the same condition that affected footballer Fabrice Muamba. \n"", 'During an eight-year career in which he scored a glut of runs across all three formats, Taylor was out to prove that when it comes to cricket size isn\'t everything. Players diminutive in stature have had excellent international careers - Shiv Chanderpaul is just one example of that - but when Taylor made his Test debut against South Africa at Headingley in 2012, even his batting partner, Kevin Pietersen, expressed his misgivings. Pietersen twice told England\'s coach at the time, Andy Flower, that Taylor should not have been selected. ""I have nothing against James but at 5ft 6ins he\'s one of the shortest men currently playing county cricket,"" Pietersen wrote in his autobiography. ""His dad was a jockey and James is built for the same gig. We were facing the fiercest attack in world cricket; I didn\'t think he was up for it.""', 'Taylor\'s response to such trenchant criticism was impressively modest of temper and even more persuasive in terms of performance. He just made runs: lots of them. He averaged 73 in 2013 and 88 in 2014 in domestic one-day cricket as he waited for almost two years for England to select him again after that South Africa series. He proved his ability to score runs in pressure situations on the county circuit, his ability to manipulate the ball and scurry between the wickets occasionally joined by unexpected hitting power. His ability to judge the pace of an innings was excellent and his captaincy of Nottinghamshire in one-day cricket also won approval. Finally, he was selected for a one-day tour of Sri Lanka as England built towards the 2015 World Cup, the first sign that what he called ""three years of frustrating phone calls"" were coming to an end.', 'Finally, 2015 was a year of growth. He played in 25 out of a possible 30 ODIs, and struck a maiden ODI hundred against Australia at Old Trafford in which his ability to manoeuvre the ball into gaps was once again again central to his approach. His red-ball record was not as impressive - five Championship hundreds in his first four seasons for Nottinghamshire - but that was pushed aside as he made 76 in a Test recall against Pakistan in Sharjah where even he could remark that the ball rarely bounced above knee height.', ""Taylor made runs from a young age. He represented England Under-19s, including at the 2008 World Cup, having progressed from Minor Counties cricket with Shropshire on his route to Leicestershire via the Worcestershire academy and second XI. A prolific 2009 season earned him the Cricket Writers' Club Young Player of the Year award. He scored heavily first at Leicestershire and then after moving to Nottinghamshire. England, though, took a while to be convinced, concerned not just about his stature but also a strong leg-side game that occasionally exposed him defensively."", 'He scored 3689 runs in 53 first-class matches for Leicestershire, at an average of 49.18, but was advised he needed to play first division cricket to advance his career and moved to Nottinghamshire at the end of the 2011 season. It was a calculated risk as he was aware that Trent Bridge, one of the toughest examinations for a batsman in England, would put his technique under pressure. He marked his first-class debut with a first-ball duck followed by an unbeaten century against Loughborough MCCU.', ""Taylor made his debut in the second Test against South Africa after Ravi Bopara withdrew for personal reasons.  He made 34 in a 147-run partnership with Pietersen, and looked comfortable enough doing it, helping to secure a draw for England in a match that turned to uproar when Pietersen hinted at problems in the dressing room that were soon to dramatically escalate. Taylor retained his place for the third Test but it was hardly the easiest time to make an impact and he was not picked for the tour of India. Illogical selection policies concerning England's performance squad - he was surprisingly omitted then added at a later date - caused further raised eyebrows. "", ""He played just once in the following two-year period - an ODI against Ireland in Dublin - and was overlooked, too, for the 2013-14 Ashes tour, but Australia's 5-0 whitewash quickened up the break-up of an experienced England side and left him well placed to push his claims once more.

His energy and enthusiasm seems boundless, whether he is smiting sixes with intent in one-day cricket, fielding with athleticism or producing a spell of bustling medium pace which never appears to be quite as fast as he wants it to be. He has always had ambitions to play Test cricket, but he has never quite managed to make the leap.  It is the limited-overs game that suits his talents and, if he is a reluctant Twenty20 specialist, it is the form of the game where his talents are most apparent. \n', 'That Test debut was never closer than when Andrew Flintoff retired from Test cricket after the 2009 Ashes series. He was called up to England\'s Test squad for the first time for the winter tour of South Africa. Geoff Miller, England\'s chairman of selectors, remarked: ""The retirement of Andrew Flintoff has created a vacancy for an allrounder… we believe Luke can make an impact at Test level."" Wright was expected to play in the first Test, but England decided upon a policy of six specialist batsmen.', 'Wright represented England Under-19s, won the Denis Compton medal four times and scored a century on his Championship debut for Sussex. He spent two winters at the National Academy based at Loughborough University, where he was right at home having studied Sports Science and Sports Massage there. He was also a key part of the Sussex team that won the C&G Trophy in 2006. The following year he smashed his maiden domestic Twenty20 Cup century, scoring 103 from only 45 balls against Kent at Canterbury.  Although Sussex were defeated in the semi-finals, Wright finished as the highest run scorer in the competition with 346 runs.', ""That captured England's attention. A whirlwind century for England Lions against the New Zealand tourists even brought loose talk of a Test debut. Instead, he was selected in the ODI team at The Oval later that summer, hitting 50 on debut against India although he drifted out of the one-day set-up following the 2011 World Cup with his bowling never quite strong enough to hold down a fifth bowler's spot. He careered up and down the batting order more than was good for him."", ""Wright performed admirably in England's World Twenty20-winning team in 2010. He contributed 90 runs in significant circumstances during England's successful campaign, and though he bowled only one over in the tournament, it was a pivotal one - he got rid of the in-form Cameron White in the final against Australia. He was also one of England's most combative performers in a less impressive campaign in Sri Lanka in 2012, his unbeaten 99 against Afghanistan in Colombo coming desperately close to making him the first England batsman to hit a T20 hundred. An injury ruled him out of the 2014 event in Bangladesh and when he was quietly omitted from England's squads at the start of Peter Moores' second term in charge his international prospects looked bleak."", 'He has also been in demand around the world for domestic T20 tournaments, playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia\'s Big Bash and Pune Warriors at the IPL. A sparkling 44-ball hundred against Hobart Hurricanes in the inaugural Big Bash League in 2011-12 was the fastest at that point in Australia\'s domestic competition. England\'s reversal of their international calendar in 2014, with the season beginning with one-day cricket, did not promote his cause at the IPL, where he did not attract a bid and, consigned once more to the start of a Championship season at Sussex, described his fate as ""woolly hat time.""', ""Wright's T20 skills were still evident, though. He smashed an unbeaten 153 with 11 sixes - at the time the fourth highest ever T20 score - as Sussex, who made 226 for 3, pulled off a world-record run chase with nine balls to spare. All the more remarkable as Sussex's players had been stuck in traffic approaching Chelmsford and Wright had joked on Twitter that any Sussex fan in the vicinity made like to open the innings. "", ""Sussex's valuation of his energy and optimism led them to give him the T20 captaincy in 2015 and follow up with leadership in all formats for the following season only for him to be afflicted by injury in a generally below-par season.

He is skinny, barely 6ft tall and bowls from a sprinter's run-up but after his speed caught the eye with Durham and the Lions, he was given a Test debut at the start of the 2015 summer. He made an instant impression against New Zealand, bowling above 90mph and celebrating wickets with abandon, kept his place for the visit of Australia and capped things off by taking the wicket that sealed England's Ashes victory at Trent Bridge. In no time at all, the imaginary horse that had ridden around the county grounds of England to stave off boredom had become a recognisable part of his England celebration. Here was a fast bowler of unsuppressed vitality. \n"", 'Like Stephen Harmison, Wood hails from Ashington in Northumberland and played for the same club. The former England quick also encouraged him to go to Australia at 18 to improve his game - not bad advice from a man who suffered bouts of homesickness away from the Northumberland coast. Where Harmison stands 6ft 4in tall, Wood is a level 6ft and delivers a whippier, skiddier ball. In his first five first-class appearances, he took 19 wickets at 21.63, including a match-winning 5 for 78 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August 2012.', ""Paul Collingwood's appetite for promoting and encouraging Durham's younger crop of players worked in his favour in 2013. He had a breakthrough summer, claiming 27 first-class wickets at 24.07 to help Durham to the Championship title and confirm his status as the latest in an impressive collection of homegrown pace bowlers. That strong showing was enough to win recognition on the England Lions tour to Sri Lanka, though it lasted only one match before he returned home with a side injury. His 2014 season was further disrupted by the first appearance of a long-running ankle problem but he was again involved with the Lions at the start of 2015 before being called up to the Test squad for the Caribbean."", ""He did not get a run against West Indies but was capped in the washed-out ODI against Ireland, picking up his first England wicket, and then replaced Chris Jordan in the Test side for a Lord's debut. Wood thought he had taken the wicket of Martin Guptill in his third over, only for replays to show he had overstepped, but he eventually finished with 4 for 140 as England won a thriller. Further limited-overs involvement followed but England were already aware Wood's workload would need careful managing - he played the first two Ashes Tests but missed out at Edgbaston. James Anderson's side strain allowed him to return at Trent Bridge and he took one of the two wickets not claimed by Stuart Broad as Australia were dismissed for 60. Two days later, the imaginary horse got an outing after Wood took the wicket that secured the return of the urn."", ""He made a blistering comeback from injury in the second half of 2016, delivering some of the most potent fast-bowling spells of the season as he helped Durham's to the final of the NatWest T20 Blast and also featured in England's 4-1 victory over Pakistan in their one-day international series. But further ankle issues ruled him out of a tour to Bangladesh and he missed India, too, after it was discovered that he bowled at the tail end of the English domestic season when his ankle was fractured. It all meant that he faced a third ankle operation within a year and, however optimistic the prognosis, cast doubts upon the resilience of a player who had won a reputation as England's fastest bowler. His comeback in 2017 was then afflicted by heel problems which limited him to five early-season Championship matches, somewhat down on pace, and saw him lose his England central contract at the end of the season."", ""Lost England contract or not, England could not resist his potential. He sandwiched a disastrous debut in the IPL (conceding 49 in four overs for Chennai Super Kinds and never seen again) in between Tests in Christchurch and against Pakistan at Lord's, where his average pace  of 87mph restated his threat, but his ODI displays were unpredictable and he admitted in Sri Lanka that he was running out of opportunities to claim his place for the 2019 World Cup. He experimented with a longer run up to try to combat his injuries."", 'Wood played minor counties cricket for Northumberland from 2008 to 2010 before making his first-class debut for Durham against Durham MCCU in April 2011.

He was 27 by then and had played six Tests. But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading. It looked as if he may be remembered as one of England's nearly men. \n"", 'But fate offered another chance. A knee injury to Ben Stokes saw Woakes recalled to the squad to play Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street. On the same day he claimed career-best figures of 9 for 36 against Durham - ""It was like facing 90mph leg-breaks,"" Paul Collingwood said - and, with Alastair Cook insisting Woakes\' batting gave him the edge (both Paul Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss wanted Jake Ball to play), he made it back into the XI.', ""It was to prove the start of a golden summer. After career-bests (up to that point) with bat and ball at Chester-le-Street, he made a maiden Test half-century at Lord's and followed it with an unbeaten 95 to help England to an unlikely tie in an ODI at Trent Bridge. It was the highest score by a No. 8 or lower in the history of ODIs and helped England recover from 92 for 6 in pursuit of 287."", ""Then, at Lord's, he claimed 11 for 102 against Pakistan, becoming the first England bowler since Ian Botham in 1978 to take a five-wicket haul in each innings of a Test at the ground. He followed it with another seven wickets and a half-century in Manchester and five more wickets in Birmingham. His 26 wickets at 16.73 apiece were a record in a series between England and Pakistan. Woakes, finally, had arrived at the top level. He was named one of "", ""'s Cricketers of the Year for his efforts."", 'In many ways it was a surprise it had taken so long. Woakes had long been a highly respected player at county level. He made his first-class debut for Warwickshire in 2006 as a 17-year-old and, before he was 20, was topping the county\'s bowling averages (45 wickets at 20.48 in 2008) with impressive control and an ability to swing the ball both ways. Most of all, though, he impressed with an apparently unflappable temperament that Ashley Giles, director of cricket at Warwickshire, admitted he would like ""to clone"" as the template for all players.', 'After two more solid county seasons, he was selected on the England Lions tour of the West Indies in 2010, where he performed admirably and was deemed ready for the next step. He made his international debut in a T20 in Adelaide in January 2011 and kept his cool to hit the winning runs in a thrilling one-wicket victory. A few weeks later, he claimed 6 for 45 at Brisbane - the second-best figures by an Englishman in ODIs. ', 'Back in the UK, Woakes enjoyed another superb summer in first-class cricket with 56 wickets at 21.78 and 579 runs at 48.25. Most of his chances for England came with the white ball, playing spasmodically over the next couple of years, before being handed a Test debut at the end of the 2013 Ashes. He performed respectably on a flat pitch, but it was felt he lacked the pace to prosper at Test level and he was left out of the Ashes squad for the return tour to Australia. ', 'Having worked hard to add that pace, Woakes was recalled in place of Stokes in the summer of 2014 and played three Test in succession against India. He enjoyed no luck, but demonstrated the skill and control to suggest he had a future at that level. But a succession of injuries - and the development of Stokes - saw him slip back among the chasing pack and he lost his central contract at the end of 2015.', ""The summer of 2016 changed his fortunes, and his growing reputation was rewarded in 2017 by a first IPL contract. But having been expected to lead England's attack in the Champions Trophy, he instead pulled up after bowling just two overs in their opening match and missed the rest of the tournament. A difficult Ashes tour followed and he was dropped from the Test side in New Zealand - his bowling average away from home having risen to 61.77 - but he bounced back during the English summer, scoring a maiden Test century, against India at Lord's.""]","['NBC Denis Compton Award 2008, 2009,2010,2011']",26.0,43,10,1012,137*,30.66,2021,50.07,1,4,132,1,12.0,0.0,84.0,57,18,1039,95*,26.64,1149,90.42,0,4,75,16,35.0,0.0,8.0,7,4,91,37,30.33,63,144.44,0,0,4,5,1.0,0.0,140.0,207,48,5620,152*,35.34,,,10,23,,,59.0,0.0,162.0,106,34,1697,95*,23.56,1891,89.74,0,4,123,28,49.0,0.0,111.0,69,36,803,57*,24.33,590,136.1,0,2,65,28,41.0,0.0,26.0,48,4600,2372,72,Jun-70,11/102,32.94,3.09,63.8,2,2,1,84.0,80,3924,3669,116,Jun-45,Jun-45,31.62,5.61,33.8,8,2,0,8.0,8,162,253,7,Feb-40,Feb-40,36.14,9.37,23.1,0,0,0,140.0,245,23651,12181,474,Sep-36,Nov-97,25.69,3.09,49.8,20,19,4,162.0,155,6966,6446,190,Jun-45,Jun-45,33.92,5.55,36.6,10,2,0,111.0,108,2175,3040,121,Apr-21,Apr-21,25.12,8.38,17.9,1,0,0

Naturally competitive, willing to innovate, capable of changing a game with bat or ball, stunning run-out or implausible catch, he had much in his favour. That feisty approach, whether as a left-arm quick committed to attack or a clean-hitting left-handed batsman, first won him an international cap against Ireland in 2015 as part of an England side determined to adopt a more attacking philosophy after their flop in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. \n', 'Willey, the son of former England allrounder turned umpire Peter Willey, made his debut for Northamptonshire at the start of the 2009 season and struck a half-century on debut. Initially classed as obdurate, like his father, but with a far less unorthodox technique, he spent a few seasons of reconnaissance before his combative style began to attract attention. There had been few grittier, taciturn cricketers than his father and it was clear that that will to win had been passed down, albeit in a more freewheeling and loquacious style.', 'His bowling really developed during the 2012 season when claimed 43 first-class wickets with his brisk swing and seam. The following summer he was central to Northamptonshire\'s Friends Life t20 success with a memorable all-round performance in the final: a 19-ball half-century (the fastest of the season), a direct-hit run-out from the deep and a hat-trick to finish off the match as part of a four-wicket haul, not forgetting a slanging match with Jade Dernbach which he partly credited for his inspirational display. It was enough for his captain, Alex Wakely, to label him ""the Northants Botham.""', 'He had already been named in an England Lions squad and the chat was increasing that full international honours, especially with the white ball, would not be far away. But he had played the final part of 2013 with a sore back and after he pulled out of the England Performance Programme squad, a stress fracture was discovered; surgery on an injured shoulder followed. Talk of an England World Cup berth in Australia and New Zealand in 2015 was abruptly stilled, but the Lions wasted little time in evaluating him in 50-over cricket when he returned for Northants midway through the 2014 season, signalling that his potential was still recognised.', ""His feisty approach first won him an international cap in an experimental England side that met Ireland in Malahide in May 2015 in what turned out to be Peter Moores' last game as England coach. Further ODI and T20I opportunities followed."", ""Willey produced the performance of the 2015 season when he struck a matchwinning century against Sussex at Hove in the NatWest Blast quarter-final, including 34 off an over from the former England slow left-armer Mike Yardy as he fewll only a metre short of hitting six sixes in an over.  He destroyed Birmingham's top order in the semi-final before Lancashire overcame Northants in the final."", ""At the end of the season, he joined Yorkshire in the most headline-grabbing signing of the season, believing that he could advance his long-form game as well as galvanising Yorkshire's less-impressive limited-overs cricket. An outstanding bowling contribution in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata brought no joy - England were pipped by West Indies in a remarkable final over - although it again emphasised his big-game talents. His switch of counties brought no immediate miracles, however: Yorkshire did reach Finals Day in the NatWest Blast in 2016, but lost in the semi-finals, Willey took only 13 Championship wickets in six matches in his first two seasons and his England limited-overs career became a strange affair as he languished deep in the batting order and rarely completed his allocation of overs; there was no place either in the 2017 Champions Trophy. A career-best 118, from 55 balls, in a T20 victory over Worcestershire at Headingley, the highest T20 score at the time by a Yorkshire batsman, was a glimpse of what the county had invested in.

He recovered, attacked the game as if each day might be his last,\nand, almost overnight, became England's fulcrum at No. 7 or 8, although he\nhas consistently been found out - like so many others - by the Australians.\nHis batting is all about aggression, and he loves the challenge of launching\nthe spinners over extra cover and sweeping them high over midwicket. Against\nthe quicks he likes to hook, and isn't afraid of getting forward - even on\nthe dodgiest pitches. His bowling relies on a muscular shoulder action and\nplenty of reverse swing at a decidedly nippy pace which he struggled to\nmaintain as injuries took their toll. When White first played for England,\nit seemed that Ray Illingworth's Yorkshire bias had overstepped the bounds\nof decency. But in 2000-01 on the subcontinent, England wondered how they\ngot by without him, and in December 2001 he hit a stirring first Test\nhundred in the heat and dust of Ahmedabad. He finally batted well against\nthe Aussies at Melbourne in 2002-03 ... and then revealed he'd ripped a rib\nmuscle while bowling the day before. England waited until the last possible\nmoment for him to prove his fitness for the 2003 World Cup, testament to his\nperceived pivotal allround role. But he again broke down, and injury limited him to nine domestic appearances as a specialist batsman.

Such was his accuracy and, for a left-arm spinner, pace - either side of medium when the ball was really biting - that when conditions favoured him an avalanche of wickets was almost guaranteed. His wizardry brought England one of the most dramatic wins in the history of Tests when, with six minutes left against Australia at The Oval in 1968, he took his fourth wicket in 27 balls. That clinched a 226-run win which squared the series, even though a lunchtime cloudburst which flooded the ground had swallowed all but 75 minutes of the last four hours. In similar circumstances at Hastings in 1973, Underwood demolished Sussex by taking 8 for 9 after a bare-footed Kent team helped the Fire Brigade mop up another flooded ground. Underwood\'s accuracy, intelligence and patience meant he was always a blessing to his captains. He adapted to conditions overseas, especially in Australia, by dropping his pace, and might have added 50-100 wickets to his England haul of 297 but for joining World Series Cricket in 1977, then the disapproved tour of South Africa in 1981-82. A game nightwatchman and a workmanlike outfielder, he was as unaffectedly pleasant at the end of his career as when, in 1963, he became the youngest bowler to take 100 wickets in his initial season. In 2008, he was unveiled as the new President of MCC on a one-year term. ', ' \n', '\nDerek Leslie Underwood was born in Bromley, Kent on June 8 1945. A left arm\nslow bowler he made his debut for Kent at age 17 and became the youngest\nplayer in history to take 100 first-class wickets in his first season. He\nachieved this feat on 9 further occasions in a county career spanning 25\nyears, and in 1966 took a remarkable 157 wickets. He was chosen for England\nagainst the West Indies, when just 21 years old and went on to play 86 tests, despite\ninterrupting his international career to play world series cricket and\nterminating it with a disapproved  trip to South Africa. His 297 Test\nwickets are included in a career total of 2465 taken at just 20 runs apiece.\nHe was awarded the MBE in 1981.', 'To describe Derek Underwood as a slow bowler, or simply a spinner is to give\na false picture of a unique performer. Much of his bowling was delivered at\na respectable medium pace, and  always off a plodding run-up of ten yards or\nso. When conditions were right he would turn the ball extravagantly, but on\ngood  pitches, against good players, he would still take plentiful wickets\nthrough his unfailing accuracy. Batsmen, infuriated or entranced by the\nunhittable length and line firing at them with the remorseless regularity of\na  bowling machine, would very often commit cricketing suicide in their\nfrustration.', 'Underwood was at his most effective on the uncovered English pitches  of\nthe sixties and early seventies. On a ""sticky dog"" the cricket slang for a\npich affected by rain he could be unplayable. Full covering failed to thwart\nhim, however, and both in county and Test cricket he maintained a high\nsuccess rate through his dedicated attention to detail. A bad delivery from\nUnderwood was a rarity and the anguish over it would be etched on his\nexpression. Although sometimes accused of bowling, a negative, flat\ntrajectory, when conditions demanded something  more flighted, Underwood\nwas a master of variations of pace and slight shifts in angle. He won\ncountless lbw victims with the ball which swung in to the right hander,\n""with the arm"".', ""Underwood's most memorable triumph of many in his long  career, was to\nretrieve the series against Australia. It had seemed hopelessly lost. The\ncircumstances of the story are extraordinary and the fact that they could\nnot be repeated now makes it a tale worth retelling."", 'It was 1968 and England captained by Colin Cowdrey had lost the first  test\nto Bill Lawry\'s Australians and then drawn the next three. Underwood, who\ndid not play in the defeat, bowled creditably in each succeeding game, but\nhis hour of glory arrived literally at the last gasp. The final Test, played\nas tradition demands at the Oval, had been dictated by England. They had\ngained a first innings lead of 170 and, although England were dismissed the\nsecond time around for 181, Australia looked doomed when they went into\nlunch on the fifth day at 86 for 5. Their salvation seemed to arrive with a\nviolent thunderstorm, which left the pitch and surrounds completely flooded.\nFurther play looked to be out of the question but when the sun appeared, the\ngroundstaff were joined by volunteers from the crowd in a frantic mopping-up\noperation. To Australia\'s dismay, the game resumed at 4.45 p.m. England had\n15 minutes plus a final, desperate hour, in which to take the 5 wickets and\nsquare the series. For 40 minutes they were denied. Then, with time and hope\nfast diminishing, D\'Olivera made the breakthrough. It was now 110 for 6.\nHalf an hour later Australia were all out for 125, Underwood having  taken\nthe remaining four wickets to clinch the victory with just 5 minutes to\nspare. Cowdrey had recalled him immediately  after the fall of the sixth\nwicket. Using the unusual conditions brilliantly, Underwood  baffled each\nbatsman in turn. Finally with every English fielder camped around the bat,\nopener John Inverarity, who had batted  through the innings for 56, played\nno shot to Underwood\'s famous inswining ""arm  ball"", and was out lbw.

Sadly, appearances - initially at least - proved misleading. In seven Tests, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he averaged 19.27 without a half-century and was repeatedly fallible on the drive outside off stump. Only one Championship hundred for Hampshire added to his mournful air. Vince did manage an ODI half-century against Sri Lanka and showed more promise in T20Is, but those who had lobbied long and hard for his inclusion were particularly disappointed with the outcome of his first international summer as his undoubted style was not matched by substance. Even then they insisted that statistics showed that his ill luck was that he tended to play and edge rather than play and miss. \n', ""But Vince was not to be denied so easily - or at least Vince's advocates weren't. He only averaged 33 in the Championship in 2017, but still found himself on the plane to Australia after England's selectors observed the failure of Tom Westley, and others, to make the No 3 position their own and turned to Vince once again. Simmering talent or habitual maker of soft 20s and 30s? It seemed that England were about to find out."", ""He began with an impressive 83 in Brisbane before he was run out, but only passed 50 once in his next eight innings. Despite 76 in Christchurch in a drawn Test in New Zealand, he was axed again in the English summer even though England were struggling for top-order options. England's new national selector, Ed Smith, seemed to want proof of desire at Hampshire. He responded with 201 from 437 balls against Somerset at Taunton but was overlooked all the same, he topped Hampshire's averages, and his 50-over cricket included a sublime 171 against Yorkshire but his defiance waned and he ended the season feebly with no score above 30 in his last nine innings."", ""A Wiltshire boy who found his way into the Hampshire set up, he was first tipped as a star of the future when the former England coach Duncan Fletcher, who worked with Vince at the Hampshire academy, said he was reminiscent of Michael Vaughan. Like Vaughan, an adherence to sound technique does little to temper his attacking instincts. To attract England's interest more regularly, though, he needed to answer a perception that he suffers a greater proportion of soft dismissals than a player of his ability should."", 'Vince has enjoyed one-day success with Hampshire, his red ball cricket has slowly advanced and he has been a regular in the England Lions squad, impressing with his methodical approach.', ""After he broke into the Hampshire side in 2009 he averaged over 50 in his first round of limited-overs matches before impressing again for England at the Under-19 World Cup. He became a First XI regular in 2010, and in August of that year confirmed his pedigree with an innings of 180 against a Yorkshire attack that included Ajmal Shahzad, Tim Bresnan and Adil Rashid at Scarborough. In that innings he added 278 with Jimmy Adams, breaking Hampshire's fourth-wicket record which had stood since 1970. "", ""Vince went past 1000 career runs for Hampshire while still a teenager - the second youngest player in the county's history behind Phil Mead to do so. In 2012 he averaged 55.50 as Hampshire won the Clydesdale Bank 40, the second part of a one-day double. 2013 saw great improvement in the County Championship and he passed 1000 first-class runs in a season for the first time. That winter he toured Sri Lanka with England Lions and during the following close season in 2014-15, was picked for the Lions trip to South Africa."", 'Vince enjoyed a stand-out season in 2014 after being named Hampshire vice-captain. He made a mighty 1525 runs - the highest tally in the country - at 61.00 as Hampshire won Division Two of the County Championship and also made a superb 93 from just 51 balls to steer his side to victory in a T20 quarter-final at Notts. ', 'His career progressed substantially in 2015 when he made his England one-day debut against Ireland in May and was named as captain of the Lions T20 squad to face Pakistan A in Dubai in December. He also assumed the Hampshire captaincy in all formats at only 24, hailed by his chairman Rod Bransgrove as ""a genuinely gifted and creative captain with a maturity beyond his years.""', 'Ahead of the 2015 season it was announced that Vince would become captain for both limited-overs formats, assuming the 50-over captaincy from Jimmy Adams. By the end of the summer, he had replaced Adams in all three formats only for his career to falter when England came calling.']",['NBC Denis Compton Award 2009'],13.0,22,0,548,83,24.9,1100,49.81,0,3,86,0,8,0,6.0,5,0,131,51,26.2,150,87.33,0,1,17,0,4.0,0.0,7.0,7,0,194,46,27.71,165,117.57,0,0,20,5,0.0,0.0,155.0,258,19,9188,240,38.44,14930,61.54,23,35,1387,36,133,0,122.0,114,7,4205,178,39.29,4336,96.97,8,20,493,29,45.0,0,173,167,16,4483,107*,29.68,3364,133.26,1,28,513,117,84.0,0.0,13.0,4,24,13,0,-,-,-,3.25,-,0,0,0,6.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,7.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,155.0,59,1633,1014,22,May-41,Jun-56,46.09,3.72,74.2,0,1,0,122.0,6,132,124,2,Jan-18,Jan-18,62,5.63,66,0,0,0,173.0,6,72,81,3,01-May,01-May,27,6.75,24,0,0,0

Yardy, whose worth in the side had been under scrutiny, had combated the illness for much of his career and as the cricket community rallied around him there was general pleasure when he returned to county cricket with Sussex in the early part of the 2011 summer. By the time he was awarded a benefit in 2014, he had spent 15 years at the county, winning seven trophies, including three Championships, and had turned himself in that time from a humdrum county professional by no means certain to make the grade to a highly-respected figure. \n"", 'His farewell season in 2015 coincided with a shock Sussex relegation from Division One of the Champion ship, but as he battled gamely - and ultimately in vain - to keep his side up, the admiration of supporters and opposition was apparent. There was a standing ovation at Hove for a century against the chamnpions Yorkshire, a farewell hundred at Hove against Somerset, and handshakes all round when he resisted again against Yorkshire at Headingley in the final match of the season. His last over in white-ball cricket - in the NatWest Blast quarter-final against Northants at Hove - went less well as David Willey struck 34 off one over and only the fact that one ball fell a yard short at midwicket stopped Yardy conceding six sixes in an over.', 'Yardy first suffered from depression when his professional satisfaction was at its peak, He had been part of the England squad that won the Twenty20 World Cup in the Caribbean in 2010 but later said: ""\'I wasn\'t enjoying life. Everything was a real struggle. I couldn\'t understand why I was in such a bad place because everything seemed to be going quite merrily from the outside. I was a World Cup winner, I was playing for a very successful England team and Sussex were playing really good Twenty20 cricket. Everything I had worked for in my professional life was going well and my family life was great and you are thinking, \'What are you doing? Snap out of it, this is ridiculous.\'""', 'Yardy\'s illness first had a direct impact upon his career when he pulled out of England\'s last one-day international against Pakistan at the Rose Bowl in September 2010. At the end of a fractious series, with revelations about Pakistani spot-fixing in full swing, nobody outside the England set-up bothered to consider why Yardy\'s Sussex team-mate Luke Wright had been preferred. He confided in England\'s coach Andy Flower and sought professional help to alleviate the illness but, like Marcus Trescothick before him, found touring with England exacerbated the problem. He would lie awake until the early hours. In Colombo, his international career - 28 ODIs and 14 T20s - came to an abrupt halt. ""I was out of my comfort zone,"" he said. ""By the last training session I was literally like a zombie.\'', ""He came back too soon and had to leave the pitch midway through a game against Middlesex at Hove, struck by a sense that he was in 'danger' on the field. But he rallied again, proving himself once more to be a dedicated and selfless captain. He relinquished the Sussex captaincy in two formats of the game in July 2013 but he continued to skipper the side in Friends Life t20, leading Sussex to their second finals day in four seasons and was also named the 1st XI Fielder of the Year, with his 34 catches across all formats rivalling numbers taken by wicketkeepers around the county circuit. He could anticipate an enthusiastically-supported benefit in 2014 after 15 years with the county.  In that time he has been the bedrock of the county during the most successful period in their history during which they have won seven trophies including three County Championships."", 'Yardy was never the most elegant player, with bat or ball, but he could be mightily effective.  A compact (stodgy in his early days) left-hander, he cemented his place by recording his maiden first-class century in defeat against Surrey, in the final match of the 2004 season. He began 2005 in identical fashion, with another hundred against Surrey, to trigger a run of form that carried him to the top of the domestic batting charts.', ""His zenith arrived against the Bangladeshis at Hove, where he scored 257 - the highest score by a Sussex batsman against a touring team, beating George Cox jr's 234 against the 1946 Indians - and followed up with a career-best 5 for 83 with his flat, left-arm spin, having started life as a medium-pacer. That was exactly double his previous tally of first-class wickets. It proved to be an effective career move."", ""His good form continued throughout the 2005 season leading to selection for the England A tour of West Indies, and ultimately a chance to push for a World Cup place when he was picked for the Champions Trophy. Though his bowling impressed, England's strange insistence that he bat at No. 4 meant that the overall image suffered, and he was quietly jettisoned.

He vowed to continue fighting. \n"", ""Tall and slim, Bracken moves the ball both ways in the air and off the seam and fitted easily into Australia's rampant one-day squad in 2000-01. He was also instrumental in resuscitating New South Wales' fortunes, including a first-innings 6 for 27 in their 2004-05 final win over Queensland and 7 for 4 earlier that season when South Australia fell for 29. A shoulder injury cut short his maiden Ashes tour in 2001 after two matches, but following a spell on the sidelines he returned to the national set-up during the 2003 World Cup, when Jason Gillespie dropped out with a heel injury. "", ""His Test debut finally came in 2003-04, but in three outings against the powerful Indian batting line-up he failed to make real inroads. In 2004 he was omitted from Cricket Australia's list of contracted players, but returned to the ODI scene for the 2005 Super Series and became a regular in green and gold. Work in the nets refining his swing was rewarded with two Tests in 2005-06 and he also added another string by delivering across the seam when he wanted to defend. "", 'The versatility and control led to 46 ODI wickets for 2006, the second most in the world, and at times during the 2006 Champions Trophy he opened the attack, dropping Glenn McGrath to first change. In 17 matches between the South Africa tour and the end of the CB Series he picked up at least a wicket in each game and he missed only one match at the World Cup, capturing 16 victims in his second campaign. ', 'His steady rise peaked after the 2008 West Indies tour when he became the No. 1-ranked one-day bowler, his 34 wickets in the previous home contest boosting his ratings. The West Indies series was also an important step following what could have been a career-ending knee injury. He required surgery and when the doctor scraped away the cartilage it was like ""old paint peeling off a wall"". ', ""In 2008-09 Australia raided the fast-bowling cupboards without calling on Bracken to assist in the five-day team's revival, a course of events reported in detail most Sundays by a Sydney tabloid. The rest of the country wasn't in shock, knowing Bracken's strengths lie in containing rampant limited-overs batsmen with his clever variations of pace and length.

","[""\nAllan Border parlayed three shots and a fanatical zeal about not giving away his wicket into the most durable career that cricket in his time had known. At his retirement he had featured in more Tests, more consecutive Tests, more Tests as captain and more catches than any other player - and a batting average of 50 as well. His underused left-arm spin once brought him 11 for 96 against West Indies, and he was also an artful one-day player with a deadly arm from short midwicket. Not a natural leader, nor a man of frills, he came reluctantly to the captaincy in a dark age for Australia after Kim Hughes' tearful resignation at Brisbane in 1984-85, but eventually applied himself to the task as proudly as to his batting. From the World Cup win in 1987 and regaining the Ashes two years later, Australia crusaded under Border until in 1993 they came within one ball of conquering the world by beating West Indies. After he retired from Test cricket he played in Queensland's maiden Sheffield Shield win, was named 12th man in Australia's Team of the Century, coached Australia A, and became a selector in 1998. He resigned his post in Trevor Hohns' panel in 2005 in favour of pursuing his media interests, particularly as a pay-television pundit, but he returned a year later to assist the new chairman Andrew Hilditch. Four months after re-joining he suddenly stepped down again due to expanding business commitments. His importance to the game is recognised annually when the Australian Player of the Year receives the Allan Border Medal.

He was not always the most stylish player, but for what he lacked in fluency he more than compensated with his ardour for occupying the crease and accumulating runs when they were most needed. As an 18 year old, Boon played a starring role in Tasmania's history-making Gillette Cup win in 1978-79, the state's first interstate one-day title, and he never really looked back over the course of an elite-level career which spanned 17 years. Among many highlights were his roles in four Ashes series wins, particularly the 1989 triumph and his honour in hitting the series-winning runs; his flawless unbeaten 184 in the Bicentenary Test of 1988; and his Man-of-the-Match winning effort in the 1987 World Cup final. Predominantly in the No. 3 position, Boon's durability was a vital ingredient in Australia's resurgence as a cricketing power in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His courage was often at the core of Australian performances and it was common to see his belligerent square cutting, driving and pulling upsetting the rhythm of even the finest of bowlers.  \n"", 'Aside from a range of triumphs with Australia during 107 Tests and 181 ODIs, Boon also led Durham in the English County Championship between 1997 and 1999, guiding the side to its best finish in the last of these three years. He was also appointed to the post of Tasmania captain at different ends of his career and was at the helm when his state enjoyed a fruitful first-class season in 1997-98. After retiring from all cricket following the completion of the 1999 county program, Boon accepted a position in marketing with the Tasmanian Cricket Association in Hobart and in 2000 replaced Geoff Marsh, his mate and former opening partner, as an Australia selector. In 2011, he took a new step as an ICC match referee, with his first fixture coming in Bulawayo, where Zimbabwe took on Pakistan. His legend also lives on at the NTCA ground in his home city of Launceston where a major stand has been named after him.

Bollinger is known for making team-mates laugh, often on purpose, but at times by accident as well, as when he took a wicket in a Test against New Zealand and grabbed his shirt, wanting to kiss the national coat of arms, but slobbered on the sponsor\'s beer logo instead.  \n', ""It took Bollinger until his mid-20s to develop into one of the country's best bowlers after being happy running around in Sydney park cricket.

At the age of 19 he had a place in the squads of Western Australia, the Perth Scorchers, and also the national team, having sensationally been upgraded from an internship on the 2013 tour of India to a more expansive role in Michael Clarke's squad. Agar's rapid rise continued when he was included in the team for the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge in 2013. Once in the Test side, he made his debut an unforgettable one: coming in at No.11, with Australia reeling at 117 for 9, Agar struck an astonishing 98 - the highest Test score ever by a No.11 - playing strokes that top-order batsmen would be proud of. He missed his hundred by a whisker, but didn't let that dampen his mood, as he picked up Alastair Cook as his maiden victim, thus becoming the first teenaged Australian spinner to take a Test wicket. \n"", ""Of Sri Lankan background and possessing a frame 187cm tall, Agar has the pedigree and the physical attributes to suggest his left-arm spin will be successful, impressing many on his first-class debut for WA against New South Wales at Blacktown Oval. He had been Australia's second spinner behind Ashton Turner at the 2012 Under-19 World Cup, but developed quickly in Perth after being plucked from under the noses of state selectors in Victoria, where he was raised."", ""After his startling start to international cricket, further success has been harder to come by with sporadic appearances across the three formats - including just two further Tests since that 2013 Ashes series.

Bichel was anything but quiet as he crashed through state batting orders and developed so much as a batsman that not even the most sceptical critic could knock back his membership as an allrounder. Bevan and Bichel, two heroes of the 2003 World Cup, did not have their contracts renewed in 2004 so they decided to become born-again stars of the domestic scene.  \n', 'In 2005-06, at the age of 35, Bichel was named the Pura Cup Player of the Year for his double of 452 runs at 34.76 and 50 wickets at 26.69. The final act of his summer was to seal Queensland the trophy by taking the last wicket at the Gabba. In three campaigns he had captured 155 victims, including a haul of 45 in 2006-07 which was capped by a state-best 7 for 54. However, he suffered a serious shoulder injury in 2007 and appeared in only three first-class fixtures, although he smashed 125 in a tour game against Sri Lanka before undergoing surgery. He wanted to come back from the reconstruction, but the journey was too hard and he retired the following season with 430 wickets for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield. ', ""Bichel was a vibrant member of the state's drought-breaking Sheffield Shield win in 1994-95 and led the attack with Michael Kasprowicz for more than a decade before Kasprowicz stepped down. His best season came in 2004-05, when he knocked off Craig McDermott's Queensland record, as he picked up 60 Pura Cup victims in a desperate push to win a spot on a second Ashes tour. Instead he performed for Hampshire that winter - he also appeared for Worcestershire and Essex - and the promotion never came. "", ""During his international career Bichel spent a lot of time coming in and going out of the squad but rarely stopped smiling. A prolific 12th man, he played 19 Tests for 58 wickets from his gutsy fast bowling and posted a half-century against West Indies, a team he always seemed to lift for. His best figures of 5 for 60 came against them at Melbourne in 2000-01, he was involved in the crushing Frank Worrell Trophy-clinching win in the fourth Test of the teams' 1996-97 series, and dismissed Brian Lara seven times on the 2003 tour. "", 'While cementing a Test berth was out of reach, Bichel was a valued member of the one-day side from 2002 to 2004 and was almost unstoppable during the World Cup. In Australia\'s group match against England at Port Elizabeth he claimed 7 for 20 with a scintillating display of bowling before sharing a 73-run ninth-wicket partnership with Bevan to nurse Australia to an unlikely but hugely satisfying victory. ""It was one of those perfect days,"" he said. Bichel also top scored for Australia with a vital half-century against New Zealand and finished the tournament with 16 wickets at 12.31 and 117 runs. Barely a year later he and Bevan were stripped of their green and gold status.', ""He maintained his links with the game after retiring and in 2009 was appointed coach of Papua New Guinea.

An essential part of the one-day outfit for a decade, especially when orchestrating calm chases in crises that often ended in last-over or last-ball heroics, he was cut from the contract list with two World Cup wins and kitbags full of highlights. He will long be remembered for his pair of sensational innings against West Indies at Sydney in 1996 and New Zealand at Melbourne in 2002, when nerveless batting and juggling of the tail secured nail-biting victories. Picking the gaps, running hard and knowing the right moment - and place - to hit a boundary were the hallmarks of his success. He was also a fine fieldsman and his left-arm wrist spin, which swung from erratic to more than useful, added to his lure and allowed him to play Tests as a batting allrounder.  \n"", 'Bevan enjoyed a promising start to his Test career with 82 in his debut innings and another two half-centuries in his first series against Pakistan in 1994-95, but he managed only a stop-start four-year campaign and was hindered by an inability to play the short ball at the highest level, which was strange as he had few problems with it in Australian or English domestic cricket. He never made a century, although he was twice unbeaten in the 80s when batting down the order and running out of partners against West Indies, who he upset with 15 wickets in the 1997-98 series. After that his Test career slid, but while he lost his baggy green he worked on making unforgettable memories in the green and gold one-day uniform, finishing with 232 appearances and a phenomenal average of 53.58 that was boosted by six centuries, 46 fifties and 67 not outs.', 'Born in Canberra, Bevan made his first-class debut in 1989-90 in South Australian colours, hitting a thrilling century in his first innings, before the completion of a 12-month stint at the Academy led to a move back to New South Wales. It was in Sydney that he began to make his greatest strides as a player, quickly assuming a regular middle-order berth in the strongest state team in the country and, aside from a poor run in 1992-93 which resulted in a brief omission, using it as a launching pad to the national team. Shortly after being cut by the Australian selectors - Trevor Hohns said his ""contribution to the one-day side had decreased"" - he signed a two-year deal with Tasmania and proved his days of domination were not finished when he struck a domestic record 1464 runs in the Pura Cup, including eight centuries. He was named the Pura Cup Player of the Year and his Bradmanesque scoring achieved an average of 97.60, but there was no return to the international arena and no sign of him being included for the 2007 World Cup. After a disrupted summer following a knee operation, he made brief appearances for Tasmania in 2005-06 and 2006-07.

After Clarrie Grimmett, Ashley Mallett, Terry Jenner and Tim May comes the offspinner Dan Cullen. An exciting dyed-blond deceiver, Cullen remains in the queue to replace Shane Warne as Australia's long-term No. 1 and has developed similar characteristics to the hero he chased for an autograph as a ten-year-old. A crafty, heavy-turner who carries a sense of mystery and Australian innovation with his ability to deliver the doosra, Cullen has shown during a steep introduction that he is unafraid to upset batsmen with his flight, dip, spin or verbal banter.  \n"", ""Although he has fallen a few spots in the national spin list, Cullen had an adequate 2007-08 as he picked up 18 Pura Cup wickets at 49.44 and he headed the Redbacks' one-day list with 13 victims. At least he used the summer to prove he is the best spinner in his state after he was dropped from the first-class outfit during 2006-07 in favour of the legspinner Cullen Bailey. Cullen retained his national contract at the end of the season - although he lost it in 2008 - as the selectors focused on his promise rather than results after 13 Pura Cup wickets at 40.76 and seven at 48.14 in the limited-overs competition. The dry returns followed a barren appointment in Somerset and the change in his mood was noticeable as he briefly flirted with copying the fall of Nathan Hauritz, who slipped from Test bowler to grade player in a summer. "", 'Cullen burst into the Pura Cup four seasons ago with 43 wickets at 30.37 and while his second summer in 2005-06 was harder - a broken finger was collected alongside 27 victims at 47.88 - he was named the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year at the Allan Border Medal. ""He has all the toys, he is young and he has got a bit of fire about him,"" Warne said late in 2005. ""He will definitely play for Australia. It is good to see we have a genuine offspinner."" Warne\'s prediction was fulfilled on the tour of Bangladesh when Cullen formed part of a rare three-pronged spin attack for the second Test at Chittagong, picking up Mashrafe Mortaza and bowling 14 overs.

If that seems a contradiction, consider that Bailey went from uncapped to captain with nothing in between. Australia were searching for a new leader of their Twenty20 side and the Tasmanian Bailey was one of the most respected state skippers, and was thrust into the role to replace Cameron White. It made him the first man since Dave Gregory in the first Test match in 1877 to be named captain in his debut for Australia in any format. Over the next couple of years Bailey worked his way into Australia's team in all three forms of the game, and was part of the unchanged XI that delivered an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14. \n"", ""\nHowever, while he made contributions in the Test team and T20 side, it was as an ODI batsman that Bailey shone brightest. A destructive striker capable of changing a match within a few overs, Bailey enjoyed an especially prolific ODI year in 2013 and at his peak was ranked the No.2 ODI batsman in the world. He was also frequently used as a stand-in captain in the one-day side and led Australia at the start of the 2015 World Cup, when Michael Clarke was injured. One of the most respected men in Australian cricket, Bailey was viewed as a mature and adaptable captain, and led Australia in two World T20 campaigns before resigning the T20 captaincy in 2014 to focus on ODIs and playing more first-class cricket.

At his peak Clarke was ranked the best Test batsman in the world, testament not only to his skill but his hard work in overcoming a chronic back injury that caused him progressively more trouble as his career advanced. Also an intuitive, aggressive captain, Clarke took over from Ricky Ponting in 2011 and while the team did not always run harmoniously during his tenure, he was at the helm for an Ashes whitewash in 2013-14 and a World Cup triumph in 2015. His retirement came at the end of a lost Ashes campaign in England in 2015, but he could be satisfied with a career punctuated by fine achievements. \n"", ""As a young man Clarke could do anything with the bat, but he matured into one of the game's most professional, reliable and focussed players. A year into his Test career he learnt that he had to shed the flourishes that made him a golden child in order to shine consistently at elite level. Breathtaking centuries on debut away and at home stamped him as a shot-maker to savour, but his method in later years was to find gaps by caressing the ball along the ground. In the field his throw was as fast and accurate as anything in the game, and he could winkle out batsmen with his disarming left-arm spin. "", 'Mostly he became known for his immaculate driving and slicing of the ball through impossible angles. His peak year was 2012, which brought 1595 runs at 106.33 and stamped him as the most in-form batsman in the world. The year began with a monumental 329 not out against India at the SCG and continued with 210 in Adelaide, where he joined Wally Hammond and Don Bradman as the only men to score a triple-century and a double-hundred in the same series. Later in the year came back-to-back double-centuries against South Africa in Brisbane and Adelaide. There seemed little he could not do.', ""But the team harmony disintegrated on the tour of India that followed in 2013, when Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur suspended four players in what became known as the homework saga. The Ashes series in England was then lost, but Clarke's Australians regained the urn with a 5-0 clean sweep in Australia at the end of the year. Clarke's gutsy century in Cape Town in 2014, completed with a broken shoulder thanks to a bouncer barrage from Morne Morkel, led to Australia's return to No.1, if only temporarily. Later in the year a statesmanlike Clarke led the country in mourning the death of his close friend Phillip Hughes, and an emotional century in Adelaide followed in what Clarke called the most important match of his career."", ""Although Clarke's ability and dedication could never be questioned, he nevertheless struggled at times to win over sections of the public, due in part to his A-list celebrity status, large endorsements and high-profile private life. There were occasions when he was booed in his own country, and at times he was accused of being too aloof around the team environment.

He fitted in perfectly in his opening appearances - he replaced McGrath, who was caring for his sick wife - and at the age of 30 experienced a dream start as the Player of the Series with 20 wickets at 15.75 against South Africa. A gamble for the first game at Cape Town, he collected his baggy green and earned his side a victory with 5 for 55 and 4 for 34, the third-best match figures by an Australian debutant behind Bob Massie and Clarrie Grimmett.  \n', ""His home welcome was equally impressive as he helped up-end England with his extra lift, gained from his 197cm height, and regular seam movement. An uncomfortable prospect, especially early in a spell, he picked up 26 wickets at 17 in the Ashes to show there was life for Australia's bowling contingent after McGrath. Clark captured at least one victim in all ten innings against England and missed out only once in his opening nine Tests. Just when England thought they had left their Clark nightmares behind he popped up at Hampshire on a short-term visit and broke Michael Vaughan's hand. "", ""While Clark quickly became a fixture in the longer form, he was dropped from the one-day team during that season's CB Series and was considered too expensive for a 2007 World Cup berth. He vowed to improve his control and won a Caribbean reprieve when Brett Lee turned his ankle in New Zealand. There was one game against Ireland and he did not disappoint in more intermittent appointments, finishing with 39 ODI caps. After 34 Test wickets were added to his collection at an average of 26.52 against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies in 2007-08, his hold on a Test place became less secure. He was dropped in India in 2008 before struggling with an elbow injury at home, the surgery ruling him out of both series against South Africa. "", ""Called for the one-day tournament against Pakistan, he made a steady return in the United Arab Emirates instead of delivering long spells in the County Championship in preparation for the Ashes tour. He played two games in the defeat and started strongly at Leeds, but was unable to make an impact after being preferred to Nathan Hauritz at The Oval. He hasn't retired from internationals, but the rest of his career will be spent at New South Wales, who he captained either side of a back injury in 2009-10."", 'A former real-estate agent in Sydney who crams study for a masters degree in commerce, Clark had to wait to strike the right market after a battle with his body as much as his talent. Clark held a Cricket Australia contract after a 45-wicket season in 2001-02 before losing it a summer later when struck by ankle and rib injuries. Hernia surgery was next on the list followed quickly by a leg problem, but he collected 40 breakthroughs in 2004-05 to re-impress Trevor Hohns and his selection gang. ', 'While on a guest stint at Middlesex, Clark was called up as a squad replacement for the Ashes tour, although he did not get a playing opportunity. He made his ODI debut during the 2005 Super Series and was a sound limited-overs performer in his first summer. A child of English-born parents who met in India, he became a father in 2006 with the birth of a son, and his life after cricket is already mapped out.

Where Lawry\'s international days finished with his sacking as both captain and opener, Matthew Elliott\'s Test career also had an unhappy ending. His triumphant summer of 2003-04 began with him proclaiming that, at age 32, he was ""past it"". It climaxed with 1381 Pura Cup runs - an all-time, all-comers record until eclipsed by Michael Bevan the following season - and his inclusion among Australia\'s 25 contracted players. Given a chance against Sri Lanka at Darwin that winter, he managed 1 and 0 and again slipped down the pecking order to finish with 21 Tests and a largely unfulfilled career. His entry in 1996-97 was startling and in his second Test, when not out on 78, he ploughed straight into Mark Waugh and mangled his knee. Two precocious, hook-laden centuries at Lord\'s and Headingley eased the pain, earmarking him as a surefooted, elegant yet powerful driver. Within two years he was on the sidelines again - this time, seemingly, for good. A naturally reserved character, the touring treadmill grated and he is rumoured to have had trouble fitting in with the dressing-room culture. Significantly, during his 2003-04 renaissance, he frequently led the Pura Cup-winning Victorians into their victory song. He put his success down to better relaxation and know-how. ""I\'ve sort of scunged a few runs,"" he said - enough, in fact, for him to be judged Pura Cup Player of the Year for a record third time. After 12 seasons with Victoria he lost motivation and fought a bitter battle for a move to South Australia as a player-coach at the end of 2004-05, succeeding only after winning a grievance tribunal appeal. His first year with the Redbacks was not happy either, a knee injury cutting into a season that finished with returns well below his lofty expectations. He was axed from the Pura Cup side in his second season at South Australia after a disastrous campaign that featured 193 runs at 13.78 from seven games, but his one-day form was superb. In 10 limited-overs appearances Elliott made 465 at 51.66, including two centuries, and he was named the Ford Ranger Cup Player of the Year.

Over the next couple of years he was a regular in Australia's Twenty20 team and a fringe ODI player. In 2009-10, Hussey topped the Sheffield Shield run tally with 970 at 57.05, including 168 in the final as he helped Victoria raise the trophy with victory over Queensland. But within a month Hussey had lost his CA contract as the selectors looked to younger men. \n"", ""Despite his crash-and-bash style, Hussey is desperate not to be pigeon-holed as a Twenty20 player, although that appears to be where his international future lies. Still, he has been a standout first-class player in county cricket and for Victoria; only Simon Katich made more runs than him in the 2007-08 Sheffield Shield campaign. He only made two centuries and his best was 104 but his consistency was remarkable. Equally impressive was his 484 FR Cup runs at 44, including a 60-ball century - the second-fastest in Australia's domestic one-day history - that featured eight sixes. It was no surprise when Hussey was named Victoria's Player of the Year in all three formats. He had come off a prolific season at Nottinghamshire, where he made 1219 runs at 93.76, including 275 from 227 balls against Essex. The next summer he struggled in the Sheffield Shield before making an important century in the final win, and he held on to his national contract. That was soon followed by a brutal 88 from 44 balls in a Twenty20 international in Johannesburg, and his maiden ODI century came against Scotland in August 2009. "", 'An aggressive batsman with a strong bottom-hand technique, Hussey hit a breathtaking, breakthrough 212 not out at nearly a run a ball in 2003-04, which was his first full-time season at first-class level. The innings came as Victoria chased a record-breaking 455 for a Pura Cup victory in Newcastle and Steve Waugh, the opposing captain, was impressed. The summer ended with 857 runs at 61 and was quickly followed by 1208 county runs in 2004. Repeating the local haul was difficult and despite starring for Australia A in one-day games - he hit a century against West Indies and a fifty against Pakistan - he was unable to hold his Pura Cup spot. The unhappy Hussey wanted a release to return to Western Australia, where he had played under-19 and 2nd XI games, but Cricket Victoria insisted he stay. Arriving in Nottingham he immediately fixed a minor technical problem and went on to gorge 1231 runs with a high of 232 not out as the county won the Championship. Another solid effort at Nottinghamshire in 2006 - he made 1103 runs at 50.13 - preceded his state-topping 911 Pura Cup runs at 53.58 in 2006-07, when he scored centuries in three consecutive matches.

While living in Pakistan's northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ahmed had been involved with an NGO that aimed, among other things, to educate women, and he said this connection led to threats against him from extremists. Ahmed began playing for the Melbourne University club and worked in a warehouse while waiting for a verdict on his asylum claim. Initially, it was rejected, which left ministerial intervention as his only hope. Cricket Australia weighed in with support for Ahmed's claim and he was granted permanent residency in late 2012. A regular bowler in the nets to Australia's Test players that summer, Ahmed was quickly signed by the Melbourne Renegades in the BBL and played three Sheffield Shield games late in the season for Victoria. A sharp turner of the ball who works from a short run-up, he collected 16 wickets at 28.37 and impressed observers all over the country. Stuart MacGill said Ahmed was biomechanically similar to Anil Kumble but imparted far greater spin. The retired batsman Damien Martyn faced Ahmed in the nets and declared him the best spinner in Australia since Shane Warne. But any thoughts of rushing Ahmed into the Test side had to be put on hold, for under ICC regulations he was not due to qualify for Australian selection until August 18, 2013, unless he was granted an Australian passport prior to that. All the same, Ahmed was already one of Australian cricket's most notable feel-good stories, and having turned 31 in early 2013, there was still plenty of time for him to push for higher honours."", ' \n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,1,1,4,4*,-,2,200,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,3,3*,-,5,60,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,62.0,74,36,410,34,10.78,,,0,0,,,15,0,34.0,13,7,83,35,13.83,114,72.8,0,0,8,2,6.0,0,78,15,9,22,5*,3.66,46,47.82,0,0,1,0,10.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,3,144,145,3,Jan-39,Jan-39,48.33,6.04,48,0,0,0,2.0,2,48,68,3,Mar-25,Mar-25,22.66,8.5,16,0,0,0,62.0,108,10881,6378,205,Aug-89,Aug-77,31.11,3.51,53,6,9,0,34.0,33,1661,1429,42,Apr-38,Apr-38,34.02,5.16,39.5,2,0,0,78.0,76,1688,1911,81,Apr-14,Apr-14,23.59,6.79,20.8,1,0,0

His cool head under pressure has won matches for Australia many times, and notably he was Man of the Match in the 2015 World Cup final triumph over New Zealand. On that occasion it was his bowling that earned him the honour, his 3 for 36 restricting New Zealand to a very gettable 183. His variations - slow balls and cutters especially - make him a dangerous bowler in the short forms and against Pakistan at the 2016 World T20 he became the first Australian to take a five-wicket haul in a T20 international. Faulkner made his Test debut in the dead rubber at The Oval on the 2013 Ashes tour and claimed six wickets, but has struggled to squeeze back into the side since then. Later that year he plundered his first ODI century - 116 off 73 balls - in a loss to India in Bangalore, in a game that will be more remembered for Rohit Sharma's 209. At domestic level, Faulkner was Tasmania's best player during a period of great success for the state. His breakout season in 2010-11 - he collected 36 Sheffield Shield wickets at 17.72 - coincided with the Tigers winning the Shield for the second time. The following two summers brought the consistent Faulkner wicket tallies of 36 and 39 and he helped the Tigers reach the Shield final in 2011-12 and win it in 2012-13 - he was Man of the Match in that final. His importance for Tasmania during those three seasons cannot be underestimated and in 2012-13 he won his third consecutive Ricky Ponting Medal as Tasmania's best player. Faulkner, whose father Peter also played for Tasmania, signed with his fourth IPL team - Gujarat Lions - for the 2016 season.

A crowd favourite, he was a lively character armed with an imposing run-up and delivery action, a classic fast bowlers' glare down the pitch, a mischievous sense of humour and a moustache of incredible proportions. And while his antics sometimes overshadowed his bowling, Hughes gave every ounce of effort to his country, and helped it to re-climb the ranks of Test cricket. Hughes made a comparatively modest entrance in the mid-1980s, but his value came to the fore against West Indies in 1988-89, when he lost pace partner Geoff Lawson to a broken jaw in the second Test. Hughes gained a hat-trick in that match, but his performance - 13 for 217 off 73.1 overs - illustrated his ability to combine the roles of spearhead and stock bowler.  \n"", ""By the mid-point of his international career, Hughes had improved his accuracy and variation and was using his bouncer, which remained a favourite throughout his career, with greater discretion. After ducks in his first three Test innings, he also become a handy batsman - albeit one who favoured a powerful, tail-enders' hoick over midwicket - and had a top score of 72 against the mighty West Indians of 1988-89. Hughes saved his greatest series performance for the 1993 Ashes tour, when bowling partner Craig McDermott was ruled out with a twisted bowel. Over the six Tests, Hughes took 31 wickets from almost 300 overs, helping Australia to a 4-1 victory. "", ""Hughes sustained a serious knee injury during the series and made only a fleeting Test comeback the following summer, finishing with 212 career wickets. However, his enthusiasm for the game continued long after his international days. He appeared for the Canberra Comets during their experiment against the states in domestic one-day cricket, and became a veteran of his local club Footscray in Melbourne. A host of supporters' tours, he made the surprise step into high-level administration when he replaced Allan Border as an Australian selector in 2005.

He announced himself to the world with a stupendous flipper to Zimbabwe's Andy Flower in the 2003 World Cup. Flower leapt back, waited for the away-spin and then slumped, hideously bamboozled, as the ball fizzed straight through on to his stumps. Until that moment, Hogg's cricketing trajectory had been anything but straightforward. Like Stuart MacGill, he had spent years in the shadow of Shane Warne. He went to that World Cup hoping to pick Warne's brain, and unexpectedly found himself filling Warne's boots. His initial Test opportunity, at Delhi way back in 1996, also arose as Warne's stand-in. He made 1 and 4, took 1 for 69, and was promptly dumped for the next seven years and 78 games. No other Australian has waited so long between his first and second Tests; Alan Hurst, dropped for 30 matches, was the previous record-holder.  \n"", 'During his time in the wilderness, Hogg learned to practise less and enjoy himself more. He began first-class life as a solid left-hand batsman, before flirting with chinamen in the nets one afternoon at the playful suggestion of his Western Australia coach Tony Mann. His batting has fallen away, although he hit a Pura Cup century in 2004-05, but his jack-in-a-box fielding makes up for it. Hogg used to be a postman - ""I do my round like a Formula One driver,"" he once bragged - and has the ever-present smile of a postie who\'s never known yappy dogs or rainy days. ', ""Claiming the Man-of-the-Series award against Bangladesh, Hogg passed 100 ODI wickets in April 2006, but was used strangely at home the following season after playing in the final of the Champions Trophy. Called on only once during the CB Series preliminary rounds, he was even released for domestic matches and seemed to be on the verge of exiting the national set-up. Cameron White's disappointing bowling turned the selectors back to Hogg, who then failed to get a wicket in the next five games. However, instead of being a World Cup passenger, he suddenly headed for the cockpit for an incredible journey. Batsmen found choosing a Caribbean bar easier than picking Hogg's tricky menu and he created as much destruction as Murali. Twenty-one wickets at 15.80 sparked many more smiles but he again struggled when given chances in the Test series against India, his eight wickets costing almost 60 apiece. Nevertheless, his decision to retire at the end of the 2007-08 summer caught many on the hop."", 'His decision to come back was just as surprising. After a brief stint as a commentator, he returned to play grade cricket in Perth. That led to a surprise call-up for the Perth Scorchers in the 2012 BBL, and his child-like enthusiasm led to a recall, at 40, to the national Twenty20 squad against India in 2011-12.

When he was dropped with an average of 58.42 only five matches into his Test career in 2005-06, he vowed to win back his place. He added only one Test, as a fill-in during a tour of the West Indies two years later, before his tally was permanently stalled at six matches in the baggy green. It was not an adequate reward for one of the most prolific run scorers in the modern era of Australia's domestic game. \n"", ""By the time the 2009-10 season arrived, Hodge's heart was no longer in first-class cricket. He began the summer with 195 against South Australia but had an epiphany when he had reached his century, stumps was near and he launched the new ball over the bowler's head for six. Hodge said it signified he no longer had the drive to play the longer format and he soon retired, although he announced he would stay on in Victoria's limited-overs teams for another two seasons. And why not? He comfortably topped the FR Cup tally in 2009-10 with 622 runs at 69.11, including four centuries, and remained one of the world's best Twenty20 batsmen."", ""In 2006-07 he had forced his way into the ODI side when Ricky Ponting rested, and a 97 and 99 not out won him a place in the World Cup squad. In the Caribbean, he finally reached three figures with 123 off 89 balls against the Netherlands, but it was his last bat in the tournament and he watched the final from the dressing room. It had become an all-too familiar viewing platform. Hodge was Australia's unluckiest casualty of the 2005-06 season of batting change. Picked for his first Test in November after being the reserve on tours to India, New Zealand and England, he opened with a fluent 60 and by the end of the home summer had 409 runs at an envious average."", 'Still it wasn\'t enough to earn a spot on the South Africa trip as the selectors returned to Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke. Included in his five outings was an unbeaten 203 against South Africa in Perth, where he joined his boyhood idol Dean Jones as one of five Australians to make their maiden century a double. Two Tests later, Hodge, a tiny right-hander who is more quiet and laid back than Jones, was dropped amid whispers of a technical flaw against fast bowling, a short drought in the Pura Cup and a selection ""judgment call"". He picked himself up with a century in the domestic final loss to Queensland but remained on the fringes of the national side, making occasional one-day and Twenty20 appearances. He held on to his Cricket Australia contract until 2009-10, but was never viewed by the selectors as anything but a back-up plan. ', ""A regular and consistent performer for his state and counties, Hodge's Victorian debut came in 1993-94 as an 18-year-old and he almost compiled 1000 runs in the season as he settled quickly at No. 4. The following years were more difficult, but he returned from the dips as a more complete player, carrying a classical technique and the ability to direct shots to all parts of the ground. Around consistently impressive one-day returns, Hodge passed the 1000 barrier in the 2000-01 first-class summer when he was a key player in the Bushrangers' march to a second successive Pura Cup final. More of the same output was revealed in 2001-02, when he shared the domestic Player-of-the-Season award with Queensland's Jimmy Maher, and his consistency pushed him towards international honours. "", ""After a brief spell with Durham in 2002, Hodge spent two productive summers at Leicestershire, leading them to a domestic one-day trophy in 2004 and making the county's highest individual score of 302 not out against Nottinghamshire the season before, but moved to Lancashire in 2005.

While back and knee injuries have worn him down at times, he pushed through the problems to join Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle in a bowling attack that could become frightening if the trio stays together. Hilfenhaus swings the ball at speed and gained seven South African wickets in the three games before going home to rest his back ahead of the Ashes tour.  \n"", ""He starred in England, leading the series wicket-list with 22, and gained approving nods from the local seam bowlers with his combination of movement in the air and off the wicket. After being Man of the Match in his first home Test in 2009-10, he missed the rest of the summer with knee tendonitis that took more than six months to ease. Back in England for the Pakistan series, his eight wickets in the two games were no surprise, but his 56 not out at Lord's was."", 'Hilfenhaus was able to lay down his trowel after a series of dramatic performances in his first two seasons catapulted him to a national contract in 2007. Two years earlier, Hilfenhaus was earning money on a building site, but his ability to shape the ball away at 140kph earned a six-figure pay packet. ""It has been a fast ride,"" he said after picking up the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year prize in February 2007. A month earlier he represented Australia for the first time in a one-day international on his home ground at Hobart, taking only 12 balls to get his maiden wicket when he trapped Brendon McCullum. ', ""A strong and fit man from Ulverstone in northern Tasmania, Hilfenhaus is only the second fast bowler from the state to play for Australia after Greg Campbell, Ricky Ponting's uncle. While shaping the ball away is his specialty, he can also angle it in and his repertoire was crucial to the Tigers' maiden Pura Cup victory in 2006-07. Hilfenhaus' 60 wickets at 25.38, the third most in the competition's history, included three five-wicket hauls, but his back-breaking workload means he is always an injury candidate. He delivered 509.1 overs in the first-class arena that summer, nearly 200 more than any of his domestic fast-bowling counterparts. His collection of 28 wickets at 43.82 in 2007-08 was not the follow-up campaign he wanted but the selectors showed faith and chose him in Australia's Test squad to visit the West Indies in 2008, although he was later ruled out due to a recurrence of stress fractures in his back. "", 'In his opening season Hilfenhaus quickly built a strong reputation and after 39 wickets at 30.82 was named in the Australia A squad for the Top End series. A former national under-19 representative, he also accepted an invitation to return to the Academy after first attending the facility when it was based in Adelaide in 2002.

Both his Test centuries came in the space of three innings, against West Indies and England in a purple patch in 1984-85, but his penchant for the fatal cross-bat shot soon became a standing joke on that England tour of 1985 when he was Allan Border's vice-captain. He played only one Test after that - and was out twice hooking Richard Hadlee. Hilditch had no reasonable defence, and was dumped for good as Australia turned to Geoff Marsh and David Boon. It was strangely out of character: Hilditch was generally a composed batsman and a responsible player - he was made captain of New South Wales after only two first-class games. He was also Test cricket's second handled-the-ball victim: at Perth in 1978-79, Hilditch was the non-striker when he returned a loose throw to the bowler, Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz appealed and Hilditch was given out. The Adelaide-based Hilditch was appointed as a national selector in 1996-97 and along with illustrious names like Allan Border, Trevor Hohns and David Boon, he helped guide Australia to world dominance at both Test and one-day level.

It was a rare treat for Gillespie, who played only 52 of a possible 92 Tests after his 1996-97 debut thanks to an assortment of ailments: busted feet, stress fractures in the back, hip twinges, side strains, dicky shoulders, torn calves, aching hamstrings, groin complaints and a broken right leg. Each time he recovered and until being dropped during the 2005 Ashes he had missed only two Tests since November 2002. Through it all, in partnership with Glenn McGrath, he blossomed into one half of Australia's most statistically successful opening pair ever. \nBut if McGrath's strength was his ability to make the ball do just enough, then Gillespie's flaw is his tendency for it to do too much. No other contemporary fast man has elicited so many plays-and-misses. It explains, perhaps, along with his slightly samey length, why Gillespie never quite imposed himself as Australia's No. 1 strike bowler. Nor has he truly dominated an opposition line-up; remarkably, the most wickets he has taken in a single series is 20. Operating from a shorter reconfigured run-up, he is not so consistently quick and in England Michael Vaughan treated Australia's fifth most successful bowler like a medium-pacer.  \n"", 'However, few Australian fast men can have owned such deep wells of tenacity. Gillespie bowls long spells in the hottest conditions - always uncomplainingly, and always with the seam upright and the ball jagging both ways - and he showed the trait again when he promised to return to the national team and memorably achieved his aim against Bangladesh. He collected eight wickets in the two-match series, taking his Test tally to 259 while McGrath, Kasprowicz and Tait were missing, but his unforgettable moment came over 574 minutes and 425 balls. His maiden century was a magnificent, unbeaten 201 that was easily the highest score by a nightwatchman. ', 'He is popular with team-mates and bashful with the public. He watches wrestling, listens to heavy metal and celebrated his first Test fifty with a bat ride embellished from the movie ', "". He was more restrained while clocking off unthinkable milestones at Chittagong and it was appropriate recognition for a hardy and valuable batting approach that has also produced two unbeaten half-centuries and a priceless 26, which sealed a hard-fought draw against India in 2004-05. A second first-class century came in 2007 at Yorkshire shortly before he retained his Cricket Australia contract. Throughout the previous home season he was certain he wouldn't be rewarded, but his 30 Pura Cup wickets at 28.43 helped him to sneak into the squad as experienced back-up, ending the idea of him moving states. With no chance of a recall, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket during the 2007-08 season and signed a three-year contract with the unofficial Indian Cricket League.

He was simultaneously a cheerful throwback to more innocent times, a flap-eared country boy who walked when given not out in a World Cup semi-final, and swatted his second ball for six while sitting on a Test pair. ""Just hit the ball,"" is how he once described his philosophy on batting, and he seldom strayed from it. Employing a high-on-the-handle grip, he poked good balls into gaps and throttled most others, invariably with head straight, wrists soft and balance sublime. Only at the death did he jettison the textbook, whirling his bat like a hammer-thrower, caring only for the scoreboard and never his average. Still he managed to score at a tempo - 81 per 100 balls in Tests, 96 in one-dayers - that made Viv Richards and Gilbert Jessop look like stick-in-the-muds.  \n', ""When he signed a record A$2m sponsorship deal with Puma in 2004, few people questioned his value for money. Indeed it was arguably Gilchrist's belated Test arrival that turned the Australian XI from powerful to overpowering. He bludgeoned 81 on debut, pouched five catches and a stumping, and barely paused for breath until stepping down in 2008. Only in the closing stages of an untouchable career did his appetite slow - he was troubled by Andrew Flintoff's around-the-wicket angle during 2005 and found the flaw difficult to overcome - and his match-turning 144 against Bangladesh in April 2006 was his first century in 16 Tests. "", ""The 2006-07 Ashes series was literally hit and miss, with three single-figure scores, two fifties and his most brutal hundred. At home his one-day form was subdued, but the game's biggest competition - and it's most important match - brought out Gilchrist's highest standards. He stole the World Cup final from Sri Lanka with 149 off 104 balls, slamming 13 fours and eight sixes, and added to his 54 and 57 from his previous two global triumphs. Using a tip from his batting coach Bob Meuleman, he put a squash ball in his glove to allow him to hit straighter - the advice should have been patented instantly. "", ""In Tests, three Gilchrist innings rank among the most amazing by Australians: his death-defying unbeaten 149 against Pakistan at Hobart when all seemed lost, his savage and emotional 204 not out against South Africa at Johannesburg, and his 57-delivery Ashes century at Perth when he missed equalling Richards' world mark by a ball. In one-dayers, his 172 is the third-highest score by an Australian and his 472 dismissals might take decades to top. "", ""As Australia's 41st Test captain he found the extra burden tiring, and was happy for Ricky Ponting to step in once Steve Waugh retired. But as Ponting's fill-in he crossed the final frontier, leading Australia to their first series win in India for 35 years in 2004-05. As a wicketkeeper he lacked Rod Marsh's acrobatics and Ian Healy's finesse, and he probably peaked at 30 in 2002. But if he clutched few screamers he dropped even fewer sitters, although one easy offering in Adelaide convinced him it was time to go.

Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon.

But the observers who had seen something in Hazlewood were to be justified, as he statistically kept pace with McGrath, or near enough to it, during the early stages of his international career. Both men had made their Test debuts at 23 and Hazlewood reached 100 Test wickets in 46 innings, just one innings slower than his idol. Along the way, Hazlewood was only once dropped from the side: mentally and physically fatigued, he was left out of the fifth and final Ashes Test in England in 2015, despite a collection of 16 wickets at 25.75 in the series.

It enabled him to shrug off years of carping that he was technically too limited for Test cricket because of the way he played around his front pad, and it enabled him to touch rarefied heights of batsmanship. Before his maiden first-class innings, he asked if anyone had made 200 on debut, then went out and hit 149. The runs rarely abated over the next 17 years. Tall, powerful and equipped with concentration befitting the fisherman and surfer that he is, he battered the ball at and through the off side for days at a time. He has also made himself a fine catcher in the slips and gully.  \n"", ""Hayden's earliest Tests were exclusively against South Africa and West Indies, a trial for any opener. They were not auspicious, but patience and willpower won the day, especially after the tour of India in 2000-01, where he slog-swept his way to 549 runs, an Australian record for a three-Test series. By the end of 2001 he had broken Bob Simpson's Australian mark for most Test runs in a calendar year - Ricky Ponting first topped Hayden's 1391 in 2003 - and formed a prodigiously prolific opening partnership with Justin Langer. Belatedly he came good in the one-day arena too, and by the time the 2003 World Cup rolled around he was ranked among the top three batsmen in both forms of the game. Later that year he hammered 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth, briefly borrowing the Test record from Brian Lara, and in mid-2004 he was at it again, battering Sri Lanka for twin centuries that took his tally to 20 in only 55 Tests. "", ""Weary through years of plunder and a difficult India tour, Hayden experienced an extended slump during 2004-05 and was initially replaced as one-day opener by Michael Clarke. His lack of form and footwork continued against England and his disastrous series only improved at The Oval with 138. It was the awkward beginning of a resurgence that extended his career and thrust him towards more middle-aged domination. Usually playing more patiently, he followed his south London renaissance with three hundreds in successive matches, becoming the third player next to Bradman and Barrington to score four in a row twice, and passed 1000 runs in a calendar year for the fifth time. After reaching three figures on five occasions during 2005-06 and adding 153 at the MCG a year later, he stood behind only Bradman, Ponting and Waugh on Australia's list of century-makers. With three hundreds in consecutive games against India in 2007-08, he quickly leapfrogged Bradman's 29, and had 30 when he waved goodbye.\n \nRegaining the Ashes in 2006-07 brought tears to Hayden's eyes and he was also saddened when Langer retired at the end of the series, although his mood lifted when he won back his one-day place. In the final match of the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee series he thumped an Australian-record 181 off 166 balls, which included ten sixes, and showed his impressive power. More muscle was on display at the World Cup as he averaged 73.22 in scoring 659 runs, the most at the tournament, and he later revealed he was carrying a fractured toe "", ' a broken bone in his other foot. A frightening 66-ball century against South Africa earned him honorary St Kitts citizenship and the outdoors man completed a dream trip by scoring another two hundreds, hooking a 136kg marlin and winning the World Cup for a second time. ', ""A year later he was back in the Caribbean only briefly, returning home without playing a Test due to an Achilles injury suffered during training while on Indian Premier League duty. Australia's top order lost strength without him, just as it had when India ended the 16-match winning streak at the WACA. He had been keen to push on until the 2009 Ashes, but disappointing displays in the lost series against India and South Africa in 2008-09 prompted him to announce his retirement after the Sydney Test.

Hauritz gained an unlikely second chance at international level in 2008-09, but quickly grew into an offspinner who could mix attack and defence successfully. He really showed his value last summer when he took 18 wickets in three Tests against Pakistan batsmen who usually cause severe damage to slow bowlers.  \n"", ""The haul followed 11 breakthroughs against West Indies and 10 in the opening three Tests of the 2009 Ashes series, when he started strongly but was left out for the final two matches. While a heel injury stopped him from being part of the series against Pakistan in England, he remains a key part of Australia's medium-term plans. During the past two years he also became a regular contributor in the one-day team, although he is less fancied as a Twenty20 operator."", ""Hauritz surprised himself with his season in 2008-09 as he leapfrogged a host of fringe spinners to finish the season as the only specialist slow bowler with a Cricket Australia contract. It was a stunning turnaround for an offie who was cut loose following his first Test in 2004. Having watched Beau Casson, Jason Krejza, Cameron White and Bryce McGain take preference following Stuart MacGill's retirement in 2008, Hauritz was picked for the second Test against New Zealand in Adelaide despite not playing for New South Wales the previous week. In three matches at home he took nine wickets and appeared in his first ODI for six years, but was kept in the dressing room for the Tests in South Africa. After four breakthroughs in the opening one-dayer against the Proteas, he was chosen in every 50-over contest over two series, leading Australia's wicket-takers in the United Arab Emirates. "", ""Hauritz, an Australian Under-19 captain, made his ODI debut at 20 and was a surprise selection for the Test tour of India ahead of MacGill in 2004. Hauritz made his debut in the fourth Test, becoming Queensland's first slow-bowling representative since Trevor Hohns in 1989, and picked up Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman after opening the bowling in the second innings. His five match wickets were a distant memory on returning home, where he struggled in first-class games and was dropped towards the end of the 2004-05 season. In the next summer he also received limited opportunities with the Bulls and left for New South Wales.

Not surprisingly, he was named the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year.

It was especially disappointing for Harwood to sit out of the season after he had six months earlier become Australia's third oldest ODI debutant, behind Bob Simpson and Bob Holland. The call-up came in South Africa, where he also played two Twenty20s and made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals, taking a wicket with his first ball in the competition. The success came at the end of the 2008-09 season, in which Harwood was the leading FR Cup wicket taker with 24 at 16.25. His shoulder problem had threatened to derail the previous summer and he finished the season with groin trouble, just one in a long list of injuries throughout Harwood's career.  \n"", ""In 2006-07, he claimed 26 Pura Cup wickets at 30.26 and 13 at 16.30 in the domestic one-dayers as his sharp pace and awkward bounce dried up the opposition's runs.

There were other highlights: he claimed a career-best 6 for 51 against New South Wales at the MCG and improved his record a month later with 6 for 38 against the same team at Sydney. But four separate health problems interrupted his progress and his propensity for sustaining injuries in unusual fashion continued. He hurt a calf walking down some stairs at the MCG during a match and missed games with a side strain and two separate buttock injuries. "", ""Two years earlier he suffered a broken hand caused by his dog dragging him off his bike, a hamstring problem during a 31-ball ING Cup half-century, a cheekbone shattered by a Kade Harvey bouncer, and finally an eye complaint. In 2005-06 his form was so impressive that Shane Warne, his Victoria team-mate, wanted him chosen for the tour of South Africa, but Harwood had to settle for 30 Pura Cup wickets at 31. He stormed on to the state scene as a 28-year-old in 2002-03 when he became only the third Australian to collect a hat-trick on first-class debut. Playing Tasmania, he knocked over Shane Watson, Graeme Cunningham and Sean Clingeleffer and was soon playing for Australia A.

In 73 one-day internationals, accumulated in ten countries across seven years, he has never hit a half-century nor taken a five-for, nor truly guaranteed himself a regular spot in pyjamas. He clubs a few runs here and nails the odd wicket there while going for around five an over, which is better than it sounds given that he bowls always in the rush hour. In England, however, Harvey's handy yorker, shock bumper, skidding bounce and flotilla of slower variations have earned him nationwide esteem. He has been instrumental in turning perennial stragglers Gloucestershire, who have never won a County Championship, into the nation's one-day wonders. Five years of hard winter yakka culminated in him being named one of "", ' Five Cricketers of the Year in 2004. David Foot, seldom prone to hyperbole, concluded: ""Few imports have ever been so influential."" Almost as an aside, Harvey is a heavy-hitting lower-order bat who in 2003 became the first centurion in England\'s revolutionary Twenty20 Cup.  \n', 'Harvey took up cricket at 14 and a few summers later found himself at the Academy, where he was dubbed ""The Freak"". He finally lived up to that nickname in 2003\'s TVS Cup final, materialising from nowhere to take 4 for 21 and puncture a promising Indian run-chase. A useful spare-parts man in the 2003 World Cup, he was dumped for the final. He lost his one-day spot in 2004 and left behind international cricket to settle overseas, playing county cricket and also having a season in South Africa with Cape Cobras. However, his application for British Citizenship, to allow him to play for Derbyshire as a non-overseas player, hit a brick wall in 2007 due to a drink-driving conviction and he faced up to the prospect of an early end to his career. With nowhere to go, Harvey signed on with the unofficial Indian Cricket League\'s Chennai franchise, the Superstars, and played a starring role (he was Player of the Series) in the team\'s lifting of the inaugural Twenty20 title.

Whether an adaptation of his first name or a comparison to the stampeding animal, it fits Ryan Harris perfectly. A hulking fast bowler who charges in and tramples the hopes of opposition batsmen, Harris delivers wickets in bulk. The only problem for Australia is a long and varied list of injuries that have kept Harris from playing anywhere near the amount of Test cricket they would have liked. He was also a late entrant to international cricket, debuting at the age of 29. For the first half of his career, Harris was little more than a journeyman medium-pacer with South Australia. A significant boost in pace came from increased strength and fitness, and by the time he moved to Queensland in 2008 - via a mistaken signing with Sussex on a British passport - he was a genuine fast bowler. His first season with the Bulls brought 33 victims at 26.48 and Australian honours weren't far away. \n"", ""His debut Test series in New Zealand in 2010 brought nine wickets and later that year he claimed nine in the Perth Ashes Test, but in the following match his intensive method of exploding through the crease led to a broken bone in his left ankle that required surgery and ruled him out for half a year. Harris already had a chronic knee injury that will be with him until he retires, but when fit he is invaluable. A hamstring injury ruled him out of the last Test in Sri Lanka in 2011, but already his five-for had helped deliver victory in Galle and his late movement helped make him Australia's leading wicket taker. He flew home from the South African tour later that year with a hip injury that caused him to miss five Tests, and on the West Indies tour in 2012 he was controversially rested for the middle Test of a three-match series. Shoulder surgery in the 2012 winter meant he missed the whole 2012-13 international summer, but a return late in the Sheffield Shield season was encouraging. Despite picking up an Achilles tendon injury in the IPL, he was able to play in the 2013 Ashes in England."", ""Australia's selectors desperately wanted him for that tour, despite the fact that he had not played Tests for nearly 15 months. Despite being left out of the first Test, he was Australia's Player of the Series in the Ashes defeat and his 24 wickets at 19.58 included a career-best 7 for 117 at Chester-le-Street and a five-for at Lord's. One of the few Australians to emerge from that tour with his head held high, Harris was also named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Few people expected him to last the full Ashes series at home, given his history of injuries, but Australia's selectors stuck with him throughout and he repaid them with another outstanding campaign. His 22 wickets at 19.31 put him second only to Mitchell Johnson, and he was Man of the Match at the SCG for his eight-wicket game. He delivered another victory in Cape Town with a bustling and tireless effort late on the final day of the series, with 4 for 32 against South Africa. Knee surgery awaited him immediately when he returned home, but he was able to recover over the winter and play in the home Test series against India.\n""]",['Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy 2002'],27.0,39,11,603,74,21.53,955,63.14,0,3,63,9,13,0,21.0,13,7,48,21,8,48,100,0,0,3,1,6.0,0.0,3.0,1,1,2,2*,-,1,200,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,82.0,122,20,2056,94,20.15,3231,63.63,0,11,,,41,0,85.0,51,19,411,39,12.84,570,72.1,0,0,,,33.0,0,64,37,15,239,31,10.86,231,103.46,0,0,12,6,23.0,0.0,27.0,52,5736,2658,113,7/117,9/106,23.52,2.78,50.7,4,5,0,21.0,20,1031,832,44,May-19,May-19,18.9,4.84,23.4,0,3,0,3.0,3,70,95,4,Feb-27,Feb-27,23.75,8.14,17.5,0,0,0,82.0,,16387,8045,303,Jul-60,,26.55,2.94,54,15,10,0,85.0,,4135,3394,123,May-19,May-19,27.59,4.92,33.6,3,4,0,64.0,63,1413,1745,81,Apr-34,Apr-34,21.54,7.4,17.4,1,0,0

His immediate predecessor was Adam Gilchrist, whose presence prevented Haddin from making his Test debut until the age of 30. However, Haddin made up for lost time by eventually becoming vice-captain to Michael Clarke and a key senior figure in a developing side. Never was he more important than in during the 2013-14 Ashes clean-sweep, when he bailed Australia out of tricky positions in every first innings of the campaign. His 493 runs at 61.62 put him second only to David Warner on the run tally and he was nimble behind the stumps, and it was only Mitchell Johnson's reign of terror that prevented Haddin being Player of the Series. \n"", ""By 2014, he was again Australia's preferred keeper in all three formats after two years earlier being usurped by Matthew Wade in all three. Haddin had originally lost his Test spot to Wade after flying home from the 2012 West Indies tour when his 17-month-old daughter Mia was diagnosed with cancer. At 34, it seemed as though his international career might be over, but Haddin showed his dedication by returning to domestic cricket and winning back his place for the 2013 Ashes tour, when Australia's selectors wanted his experience and poise. Renowned as a loyal team man who could be brusque with the media, Haddin was a valuable lieutenant and sounding board for Clarke during the back-to-back Ashes series."", ""Haddin's first taste of Test cricket had come in the West Indies in 2008, when he played through the pain of a broken finger. Flaws in his keeping were on show in India in 2008 but his glovework gradually improved, and a batting breakthrough in 2008-09 gave him confidence. In his 16th Test innings he passed 50 for the first time and went on to 169 against New Zealand in Adelaide, showing flashes Gilchrist would have accepted. An important one-day batsman who shuffled around the order, Haddin also had the chance to captain Australia in T20s in 2009 when Ricky Ponting, Clarke and Michael Hussey were rested. He was also starting to prove himself a productive Test run-maker, which continued on the 2009 Ashes tour with 121 in Cardiff and 80 at Lord's, where he also gave up 20 byes as he struggled to deal with the late movement. A broken finger gave Graham Manou an opening at Edgbaston, but Haddin returned for the final two Tests. "", ""He remained a useful batting contributor in 2009-10 but his highlight was the spectacular, one-handed take at full stretch down the legside off Salman Butt. It was a hugely impressive catch that helped Australia to an unbelievable win at the SCG in 2009-10. (New Zealand supporters find it hard to forget the glove-assisted bowled of Neil Broom in a one-day game the previous summer.) Another injury, a batting-related elbow problem, rubbed him out of the Pakistan series in England, where Tim Paine was used, and after 136 in the opening Ashes Test of 2010-11, Haddin endured a more difficult period in 2011. Notably, he was one of the major culprits in Australia's 47 all out in Cape Town, when at 18 for 5 he backed away and tried to drive Vernon Philander on the up through the off side, gifting South Africa a sixth wicket. A lean home series against India followed, before Wade took his place in the West Indies."", 'A valuable presence in the limited-overs sides, Haddin has scored ODI centuries opening the batting. He is a clean, effortless hitter and his lofted straight drive is among the best shots in the game.

That summit came during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves. Not surprisingly it led to Johnson winning his first Allan Border Medal, and at the age of 32 he was finally achieving the sorts of feats that Dennis Lillee might have expected when he first spotted Johnson's talent as a 17-year-old. There had been other highlights along the way for Johnson, including brutal spells against South Africa in 2008-09, but the lows of his 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes campaigns left his legacy looking uncertain. Nerves and family problems contributed to those struggles, but a broken toe in 2011 gave him time away from the game and the chance to reflect on where he was going. \n"", ""It was still far from smooth sailing: he offered little on the 2013 tour of India and was not even picked for the 2013 Ashes in England, but his return for the home Ashes that followed was emphatic. Wearing a moustache reminiscent of Lillee, he delivered a series of fast-bowling spells that would not have been out of place in the Lillee-Thomson era. Johnson intimidated with his bouncer and made England's batsmen seriously uncomfortable; that he was Player of the Series was no surprise. As described by "", ', the mood changed whenever he tore in: ""This was something visceral: a hush followed by a crescendo"". A 12-wicket Test in Centurion in Australia\'s next series showed that it was no fluke. After that South African tour Johnson\'s pace eased off again, but he remained a strike weapon and became the fifth Australian bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests.  ', ""An athlete who started out preferring tennis, Johnson was late to focus on cricket and suffered early in his career with four back stress fractures that almost floored him for good. He persevered, driving a plumbing van when he lost his Queensland contract, and made his Test debut in 2007 after the retirement of Glenn McGrath. With a strong, flowing run to the crease, Johnson can become mechanical in delivery, especially if his wrist, a long-term concern, is in the wrong position. When it's bad, he sprays the ball on both sides of the wicket like an old-fashioned firebrand. When it's perfect, there are few better bowlers in the game. The late swing at pace is a major problem, along with sharp bounce, and sometimes it's just the angle across the batsmen that undoes them. Off the field he is often so quiet that it is hard to reconcile with his on-field speed and aggression. Also a clean striker with the bat, Johnson scored a Test century in South Africa in 2009, but never quite reached the genuine all-round status that once seemed possible.\n"", '\n']","['ICC Cricketer of the Year 2009', 'Allan Border Medal - 2014', 'ICC Cricketer of the Year 2014', 'ICC Test Player of the Year 2014']",73.0,109,16,2065,123*,22.2,3536,58.39,1,11,247,31,27.0,0.0,153.0,91,32,951,73*,16.11,987,96.35,0,2,81,23,35.0,0.0,30.0,17,7,109,28*,10.9,95,114.73,0,0,8,3,5.0,0.0,117.0,170,31,3180,123*,22.87,,,2,15,,,39.0,0.0,184.0,108,39,1115,73*,16.15,1223,91.16,0,2,,,39.0,0.0,112.0,52,27,320,30,12.8,304,105.26,0,0,23,10,28.0,0.0,73.0,140,16001,8891,313,Aug-61,12/127,28.4,3.33,51.1,16,12,3,153.0,150,7489,6038,239,Jun-31,Jun-31,25.26,4.83,31.3,9,3,0,30.0,30,656,797,38,Mar-15,Mar-15,20.97,7.28,17.2,0,0,0,117.0,,23765,13352,465,Aug-61,,28.71,3.37,51.1,24,17,4,184.0,,9227,7387,284,Jun-31,Jun-31,26.01,4.8,32.4,11,4,0,112.0,111,2494,3172,123,03-Mar,03-Mar,25.78,7.63,20.2,0,0,0

His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments.

However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia searched in vain for something to turn their disastrous series around.

Only a severe back injury that restricted his movement could stop him; unfortunately it led to three operations and the loss of his contract in 2009. Jaques finished the 2008 West Indies tour with a century in the final Test, but he was dropped for the next match in India when Matthew Hayden returned and Simon Katich was the preferred partner. The back was already creaking and he was soon flying home for an operation, confident his comeback would be swift. Some complications, more surgery and the emergence of Phillip Hughes meant there were no openings even after Hayden's retirement. He returned to fitness for New South Wales in 2009-10 and was content with a summer that included a Shield hundred and a state record 171 not out in the FR Cup. \n"", ""Given two Tests in Justin Langer's absence, Jaques became Langer's full-time replacement in 2007 and was so successful in his first season that his predecessor's fine output wasn't missed. Starting neatly with a determined 100 against Sri Lanka at the Gabba, he followed up his breakthrough innings with a biffing 150 in the next game in Hobart. A bout of the mumps was a brief interruption, but he regained health in time for the India series and, after overcoming a slow start in the West Indies, finished with scores of 76, 31 and 108 to register 806 runs at 50.37 in nine matches. They were figures that would have pleased Langer or Hayden, a pair which also had to spend extended periods fighting for national recognition."", 'Jaques was holidaying on Queensland\'s Hamilton Island in 2005 when the Test call finally came to satisfy an early-career gamble. A British passport holder, Jaques was the victim of a country tug-o-war in 2003 after scoring 1409 County Championship runs with Northamptonshire, but he refused to commit to England because ""my heart says Australia"". Jaques maintained such a consistent standard with New South Wales [1191 runs in 2004-05] and Yorkshire [1359 in 2005 and 1118 in 2004] that when Langer was ruled out of the Boxing Day Test against South Africa Trevor Hohns said simply: ""Phil virtually demanded selection.""', 'Jaques had to introduce himself to Ricky Ponting before his Test debut, but his reputation had already excited the Australian captain, and Steve Waugh believed he had the potential to be the next Adam Gilchrist. ""Australia is lucky to have a player like him coming through,"" Waugh said. ""He is the prototype for young players."" However, his first game was a quiet one - he walked after squirting Shaun Pollock to short leg for 2 and improved with 28 in the second innings. Another opportunity came in the second Test in Bangladesh in 2006 and he produced a capable 66.', ""With an attacking mindset and home-made technique, he has shown the ability to score big runs on northern English greentops and hard-baked pitches in Australia and Pakistan, where he toured with Australia A in 2005 and 2007. Injuries have provided him with openings throughout his career - he made his first-class debut with 40 at No. 10 as a late addition against Queensland in 2000-01 - and a Katich groin problem was responsible for his one-day international call-up in the middle of the 2005-06 VB Series.

For the brash 21-year-old who waltzed into the Australian team at Dean Jones's expense, batting was an exercise in extravagance. To defend was to display weakness - a policy that backfired in 1993-94 when Martyn's airy square-drive at a crucial moment in Sydney triggered a five-run defeat by South Africa and a six-year hitch to his own promising career. By the time Western Australia, wanting a pretty face to spearhead their marketing campaign, had made him captain at 23, Martyn looked a tormented man. All the more remarkable, then, that he blossomed into a relaxed, classical, feathery artist. He was an elastic fieldsman and an old-style batsman whose first movement was back. He played with a high elbow, a still head, a golfer's deft touch, and had all the shots, including perhaps the most brutal reverse-sweep in the game.  \n"", 'Mostly, though, Martyn stuck to the textbook and composed pristine hundreds which, like the feats of the best wicketkeepers, passed almost unnoticed: an observation supported by the curious fact that, despite a Test average in the fifties, he reached the age of 30 without winning a Man-of-the-Match award. He was the quiet man of the 2003 World Cup-raising side, too, playing a minor role until he spanked 88 not out in the final - with a broken finger that later kept him out of a West Indian tour. His magnificent 13-month streak of 1608 Test runs at 61 and two Man-of-the-Series prizes from March 2004 finally moved him from the dressing-room shadows to the more uncomfortable limelight. Showing his hard-earned versatility, he crafted seven centuries on surfaces ranging from raging turners in Sri Lanka and India to green seamers in New Zealand and the hard bounce of home. ', 'The flood ended in England and following a series of 178 runs and a couple of horrid umpiring decisions he was the major casualty of the Ashes loss. Retaining a one-day spot, he expected his five-day days were over - ""If that\'s my last Test match, well, I\'ve had a great time"" - but was reprieved when the selectors wanted experience for the South Africa tour. As the decision to ignore policy by looking back to a 34 year old became increasingly doubtful, Martyn repaid with a nerveless 101 that led to victory in the final Test. After being a key part in Australia\'s first Champions Trophy success, he struggled in the opening two Tests of the Ashes series and swiftly retired. ', ""In February 2008 he swung another surprise of sorts by announcing he had joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League and when that became defunct, comeback-kid Martyn had another unexpected return, signing for Shane Warne's IPL side Rajasthan Royals for US$100,000 in January 2010.

After a poor first outing for an Australian touring team, in which he gave up 199 runs in 31 overs, Krejza's chances of playing a Test on the 2008-09 tour of India seemed bleak. But when he was finally picked ahead of Stuart Clark for the deciding Test in Nagpur, Krejza collected staggering debut innings figures of 8 for 215. It was a bittersweet debut, however, as Krejza also conceded more runs than anyone in their maiden Test performance. He went on to finish with 12 victims for the game; of Australian players only Bob Massie ended his debut Test with better figures. \n"", ""It was a brilliant way for Krejza to round out a 12-month period that had started in ignominy. A year before his Test call-up, Krejza was caught drink-driving and speeding, and lost his licence for seven months. Tasmania imposed their own punishment on him - he was suspended from their pre-season training and banned from alcohol for the whole summer. He rewarded the state with a solid, if not spectacular, Pura Cup season that brought him 18 wickets at 47.11 from seven games. That was enough for an Australia A call-up and then the higher honour as the national selectors scoured the country for the next Test spinner, and it also justified Krejza's decision to head south during 2006-07. He had squeezed out of a tight queue of New South Wales slow bowlers and transferred to Tasmania, where the line was much shorter. Stuck behind Stuart MacGill with the Blues' new imports, Nathan Hauritz and Beau Casson, Krejza had three productive one-day outings before his mid-season departure but his lack of first-class action was the sealer. In Tasmania it was the other way around; Xavier Doherty was the established one-day spinner but Krejza was given Pura Cup opportunities."", ""An offspinner who is willing to flight the ball and can extract decent turn, Krejza's debut season at New South Wales raised eyebrows as he picked up Michael Bevan, a more than handy player of spin who spent years at the SCG, three times. The summer ended with nine Pura Cup matches and 12 wickets. The following campaign was less productive as Steve O'Keefe and Aaron O'Brien were also employed, before Hauritz and Casson swelled the stocks further. Until he burst onto the Test scene, Krejza did not have a first-class five-wicket haul to his name but his resume did include solid batting - he has four first-class half-centuries. Krejza spends his time away from the game singing and playing guitar, and he has an interesting family history; his father is a footballer from Czechoslovakia and his mother is from Poland. \n"", ' November 2008']",['New South Wales club: Fairfield-Liverpool'],2.0,4,1,71,32,23.66,146,48.63,0,0,8,0,4.0,0.0,8.0,2,1,13,7,13,23,56.52,0,0,0,0,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54.0,82,19,1587,118*,25.19,3230,49.13,2,7,,,31.0,0.0,58.0,44,11,615,52*,18.63,651,94.47,0,1,,,25.0,0.0,29.0,19,7,165,33*,13.75,168,98.21,0,0,5,6,8.0,0.0,2.0,4,743,562,13,8/215,12/358,43.23,4.53,57.1,1,1,1,8.0,8,425,331,7,Feb-28,Feb-28,47.28,4.67,60.7,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54.0,,8959,5654,114,8/215,,49.59,3.78,78.5,4,1,1,58.0,,2796,2322,61,Jun-55,Jun-55,38.06,4.98,45.8,2,1,0,29.0,29,599,750,30,Mar-13,Mar-13,25,7.51,19.9,0,0,0

The international grounding and a backyard net helped develop Marsh into one of the finest young run-makers in the country. It also gave him a taste of what he could expect when he joined the national team. He made a successful start to his ODI career in 2008 and then scored a superb century on Test debut in Sri Lanka in 2011. Marsh looked set for a lengthy tenure as Australia's No.3 but a back injury suffered during Australia's disastrous Cape Town Test later that year proved a serious setback. Marsh rejoined the side for the home Tests against India but was a shadow of himself, and 17 runs from six innings was a calamitous return. He was recalled for the 2014 tour of South Africa and scored 148 in Centurion, but was dropped again after making a pair in the next Test.  Another recall came at home against India when Michael Clarke was injured, and 99 at the MCG suggested he still had something to offer.  \n"", 'But in his only Test on the 2015 Ashes tour he scored 0 and 2, and it seemed that might have been his last chance. Until he was given another, included to replace the injured Usman Khawaja for the inaugural day-night Test against New Zealand in 2015-16. Permanency has never arrived, however, through a mixture of form and injury. It felt as though the 2017-18 Ashes promised something better with two hundreds in the series, including one against the pink ball in Adelaide, but there was a subsequent slump in form that again brought the spotlight on his position.', 'Marsh has appealed to a series of Australian selection panels, who have viewed him as a viable top-order prospect in Tests and ODIs especially. His first-class record may be underwhelming for a man given so many chances and his penchant for nicking off early has proved a frustration, but he has also shown himself to be capable of scoring hundreds at the highest level. More gifted than his father - ""He\'s got a few more shots than me,"" Geoff once said - Marsh is a left-hander who impressed the tough judges of Steve and Mark Waugh while scoring his maiden first-class century in 2003. The milestone arrived with two sixes in a row over midwicket off Mark Waugh\'s offspin and a rash of compliments. ""It\'s a pretty good feeling when the Australia captain comes up to you and says \'well done, mate\',"" Marsh said. Marsh is at his best when playing classical shots and keeping the ball along the ground, which has been effective even in the shorter formats of the game.

Incredibly, Manou replaced Haddin just moments before the Edgbaston Test when Haddin broke a finger. It was a memorable, one-off taste. A few months later he was flown in as an emergency replacement for Tim Paine during the ODI series in India and played four ODIs.  \n', ""Manou's promotion came 10 years after his state debut and was sealed when he raised two Pura Cup centuries in a collection of 647 runs to go with 33 dismissals, staying ahead of Chris Hartley, Matthew Wade and the deposed Luke Ronchi. It was a rise built on hard work and recognition that he needed to mature after being dropped by South Australia two seasons ago. However, at the end of 2009-10, a summer in which he struggled with a knee injury, he was replaced as captain."", ""In 2007-08 Manou not only overcame the major challenge to fight his way back into South Australia's Pura Cup team, he ended up as captain by the end of it after Nathan Adcock was dumped from the XI. He was the top runscorer by far, with 596 runs at 37.25, playing all ten Pura Cup matches after Shane Deitz was mysteriously overlooked. There were also eight one-day matches and a high score of 50. "", ""Manou, who was then vice-captain, had been dropped the previous year after managing only 16 runs from two games early in the summer. He retained his one-day spot and led the team when Darren Lehmann was injured, but his return was a disappointing 117 runs at 14.62. His unexpected lull came after he was named Lehmann's deputy and he was immediately thrust into the leader's role in 2004-05, when he was a strong performer in a difficult campaign with 433 runs and 36 dismissals. The next year he took his keeping to new levels with a personal-best collection of 42 Pura Cup dismissals and added another 21, including six stumpings, in the ING Cup. That season he narrowly missed a second first-class century when reaching 91 against Tasmania but his batting wasn't as lucrative as in 2003-04, when he collected $50,000 for hitting an ING sign. "", ""After a glittering junior career, he made his first appearance in interstate ranks at senior level in 1999-2000 when he replaced the recently-retired Tim Nielsen to become South Australia's top wicketkeeper. He created a favourable impression with tidy and athletic glovework and his obvious comfort in keeping to all types of bowling. Manou struggled initially with the bat - he registered ducks in four of his opening five innings on the first-class stage - but grew into an important role player and picked up 130 as an opener in 2003-04. Manou's under-age career reached its highest point when he was the Player of the Tournament as his state's captain at the 1997-98 national under-19 carnival in Melbourne."", ' September 2010']","[' ', ' ', 'Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy 1998']",1.0,2,1,21,13*,21,39,53.84,0,0,3,0,3.0,0.0,4.0,1,0,7,7,7,6,116.66,0,0,0,0,5.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,103.0,175,18,4003,190,25.49,7061,56.69,6,20,,,328.0,21.0,118.0,99,25,1613,63,21.79,,,0,4,,,152.0,16.0,41.0,33,5,304,43,10.85,293,103.75,0,0,24,5,24.0,11.0,1.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,4.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,103.0,,12,8,0,-,-,-,4,-,0,0,0,118.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,41.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

The previous year, he had taken up a job on the Adelaide Oval groundstaff, and his bowling talent was spotted by the Redbacks' Big Bash coach Darren Berry. Lyon impressed in Twenty20s for South Australia, made his first-class debut, and within seven months was a Test cricketer. A classical offspinner who flights the ball and looks for wickets, Lyon struck with his first ball in Test cricket when he had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip in Galle. It was part of a haul of 5 for 34 and the beginning of a career that would, for the most part, end Australia's cycle of churning through Test spinners in the post-Warne era. By 2015, Lyon had become Australia's most successful Test offspinner of all time, passing Hugh Trumble's tally of 141 wickets, and following the post-Ashes retirements of Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Shane Watson, he became one of the team's most experienced players. \n"", ""However, Lyon's career was not without bumps along the way. In 2013 he was dropped from the Test team twice, first in India after he was attacked by MS Dhoni in the first Test in Chennai, and then for the first two Tests of the Ashes tour of England. The Ashes axing was especially galling for Lyon, given that he had taken nine wickets in his previous Test, the fourth and final Test of the Indian tour in Delhi, and he was overlooked for the uncapped teenager Ashton Agar. By the third Test of the Ashes, Lyon was rightfully back in the side and continued to be a consistent performer. One gap in his game had been the ability to bowl Australia to victory in the fourth innings of a Test, but he finally achieved that against India in Adelaide in 2014-15, in what became his first Man-of-the-Match performance. Lyon has also played a handful of one-day internationals but, despite first making his name for South Australia in T20, he has generally been considered by the national selectors a Test-only prospect.\n"", '\n']",[],86.0,111,34,923,47,11.98,2007,45.98,0,0,116,5,41.0,0.0,21.0,11,8,69,30,23,73,94.52,0,0,7,2,4.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,4,4*,-,4,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,145.0,185,53,1682,75,12.74,3431,49.02,0,2,196,15,63.0,0.0,63.0,31,17,205,37*,14.64,199,103.01,0,0,18,8,27.0,0.0,40.0,15,6,51,11,5.66,54,94.44,0,0,4,0,12.0,0.0,86.0,164,21905,11059,343,Aug-50,13/154,32.24,3.02,63.8,13,14,2,21.0,21,1182,942,22,Apr-44,Apr-44,42.81,4.78,53.7,1,0,0,2.0,2,30,48,1,Jan-33,Jan-33,48,9.6,30,0,0,0,145.0,266,34445,17632,510,Aug-50,13/154,34.57,3.07,67.5,20,16,2,63.0,62,3421,2739,76,04-Oct,04-Oct,36.03,4.8,45,4,0,0,40.0,39,820,981,49,May-23,May-23,20.02,7.17,16.7,1,1,0

But two prolific seasons for Queensland, punctuated by a successful sojourn in south Wales for Glamorgan, propelled Maher back into the one-day reckoning. He announced his return with 95 in the second match against South Africa at Centurion in 2002, and followed that up with a vital 43 not out to secure a tie at Potchefstroom.  \n', ""A country boy from the far north of Queensland - he was born in Innisfail, just south of Cairns - Maher's bubbly personality made him a popular member of dressing rooms from the Gabba to the Gower. He took a while to get the hang of English pitches, but innate footwork and savvy shot-selection won through in the end. He continued that form back in Australia, slamming 174 against Victoria and 209 against South Australia on his way to becoming the first batsman to reach 1000 Pura Cup runs in 2001-02. A series of handy one-day performances won him a place as the spare batsman (and the stand-in wicketkeeper) in the 2003 World Cup-winning squad, although he appeared in only two matches. Tours to West Indies and India followed but his 26-match one-day journey ended when Brad Haddin assumed the back-up gloveman's role. "", ""Replacing Stuart Law as Queensland's captain, Maher lost five domestic finals in a row before sealing his first win as leader with the 2005-06 Pura Cup. He marked the occasion with a career-high 223 and then let his batsmen race to an unstoppable 6 declared for 900, dedicating the victory to victims of a fierce cyclone in north Queensland the previous week. Maher's Man-of-the-Match performance guided him to a personal haul of 906 runs at 53.29 in the competition and showed that at 32 he had energy left. "", ""The run-scoring leader in the interstate one-day tournament, Maher's stand-out limited-overs moment came with a national-record 187 from 129 deliveries against Western Australia in 2003-04 as the Bulls charged to an unmatched 405 in 50 overs. He also values highly his 108 in the limited-overs final of 2006-07, which set up Queensland's FR Cup victory at the MCG.

Learning to enjoy his job was central to the stunning revival from seemingly washed up domestic batsman to respected Test player. Rather than trying to prove anything to the Australia selectors who cut his national contract in 2007, he conceded he was struggling and deserved to be dropped.

The method depends on the situation and how he feels, with his body language usually giving away the mood. An accomplished leader of New South Wales, he has plenty to offer tactically, although he is expected to be too old to be a serious contender as the next Test captain.

Like India. A swing bowler who learned to weave outswingers on Gabba greentops, Kasprowicz matured into a subcontinental specialist with reverse-swing, heavy cut and a this-isn't-too-hot-for-another-over attitude. He bravely carried an injury-hit attack struck by Navjot Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar in 1997-98, popped back in 2001 and returned in 2004 to help end India's 35-year hold. And when his first-class career finished in 2007-08 he joined the Indian Cricket League. \n"", ""After three years mostly spent refining his efficient yet aggressive action with Queensland and Glamorgan, Kasprowicz celebrated his fifth recall in 2004 with 13 matches, his longest Test run. During the wildly successful year the prongs of McGrath, Gillespie and Kasprowicz were so sharp that Brett Lee ran their refreshments. To call Kasprowicz a workhorse is unflattering even though the description matches his stamina and size - he was an Australian Schoolboys rugby forward. Regularly clocked faster than his new-ball counterparts (excluding Lee) from a shorter run, Kasprowicz's angle and dart-perfect line caused constant headaches for international left-handers in the style of Paul Reiffel, another under-rated third wheel. He became an important clean-up or go-to man and only four times in 2004 did he leave an innings without a wicket as he collected 47 victims. "", ""An intimidating and muscular presence at county and state level - he often broke bones in England and peer pressure from Pura Cup batsmen hurried his Test and one-day returns - Kasprowicz became Queensland's leading wicket-taker in 2003-04, but after missing most of 2006-07 he had a battle to stay ahead of his best man Andy Bichel. Back and groin problems, which started in South Africa and were irritated by the pre-Ashes boot camp, limited him to a season of eight deliveries for Queensland and he lost his Cricket Australia deal. The problems also contributed to an abbreviated final campaign of 15 breakthroughs, which was enough for him to retire as the state's highest wicket-taker with 501 first-class dismissals - at the time it was 38 more than Bichel."", ""Popular and cheerful off the field, `Kasper' experienced the lows of being 12th man for Queensland's first Sheffield Shield win in 1994-95, waiting five months and three Tests for his first wicket and completing a regular do-si-do for a national place with Bichel. However, his greatest miss came during the 2005 Ashes series when his courageous 59-run partnership with Lee at Edgbaston ended three short of victory. After adding 20 he gloved a contentious catch behind and England levelled the series 1-1. Returning from that tour on the outer, he responded with 44 Pura Cup wickets for the Bulls and was recalled for the trip to South Africa, where he and Lee reversed their Birmingham nightmare with a 19-run stand that earned a nail-biting two-wicket victory. It was the final act of an eventful and satisfying Test career.

""I came through a different path,"" he says. ""At a younger age I wasn\'t really that good at cricket, to tell you the truth."" In his 20s he moved to Melbourne, joined the Northcote club to play grade cricket and steadily moved up the ranks, making his first-class debut as a 25-year-old.  \n', 'A fast, accurate and skidding bowler with an aggressive attitude, he collected five wickets in the first innings of the 2000-01 Pura Cup final in Brisbane and showed a high level of consistency by capturing more than 25 Pura Cup victims in each of the four seasons before 2006-07. The 2004-05 summer was his best at state level as he picked up 38 wickets at 22.05 to earn a Cricket Australia contract, and he spent parts of the winter in Durham, where he was occasionally mentioned as an Ashes prospect, and in Pakistan with Australia A. ', 'Influenced heavily by the fast bowler Rodney Hogg, Lewis became a one-day international aged 31 - the oldest since the 38-year-old Bob Holland in 1984-85 - and made an instant impact with 3 for 56 against New Zealand. Respected as a death bowler in domestic games, he delivered a nerveless final over of the second Chappell-Hadlee Series match and sealed a two-run win and the trophy with a desperate run out. ""I had to do what I know I can do - bowl full and straight and at the stumps."" Such qualities didn\'t help him at Johannesburg in March 2006, when he was smeared for 113 runs in his ten overs - the most ever conceded in a one-day international. The performance and an overall economy rate of 6.87 in his seven games led to him losing his Cricket Australia contract. The 2006-07 domestic season was a frustrating one for Lewis, who missed time with a hip muscle injury and was eventually dropped due to poor form.

Having arrived on the state cricket scene as a 17-year-old, Lehmann had played more first-class games and scored more runs than any other Australian before making his Test debut in Bangalore in 1998, although his record was later beaten by Michael Hussey. He initially struggled to hold down his Test spot but eventually bucked the trend of youth by establishing himself in the Australia side at 33 with a maiden hundred at Port-of-Spain in his tenth Test, and then two against both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the next 12 months. Named stand-in vice-captain for the 2004 India tour when Ricky Ponting broke his thumb, Lehmann offered to give up his place to Michael Clarke after his amazing debut century at Bangalore, and limped out of the series after the third Test with a torn hamstring.

He was also a key member of the side that defended the title four years later, although his entry into the tournament was delayed by a suspension for a racist dressing-room outburst. An integral member of winning Sheffield Shield sides in 1990-91 and 1995-96 and Yorkshire's victorious County Championship team of 2001, Lehmann finished his first-class career as the highest run scorer in Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup history, with 13,635 runs at 54.97. He entered coaching via the IPL, where he was at the helm of the Deccan Chargers when they won the tournament in 2009. Lehmann was named coach of Queensland in early 2011 and quickly won the respect of the players for his straightforward approach. Under Lehmann, the Bulls won the 2011-12 Sheffield Shield and the 2012-13 Ryobi Cup. His success and popularity with his players made him an attractive candidate for higher coaching honours and Cricket Australia sprung a surprise by sacking Mickey Arthur and naming Lehmann coach of the national side less than three weeks before the start of the 2013 Ashes.\n "", '\n']","['Walter Lawrence Trophy 2000', 'State Player of the Year - 2000', 'Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2001', 'State Player of the Year - 2001', 'State Player of the Year - 2002', 'Wisden Australia Cricketer of the Year 2004-05']",27.0,42,2,1798,177,44.95,2909,61.8,5,10,214,10,11.0,0.0,117.0,101,22,3078,119,38.96,3784,81.34,4,17,227,14,26.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,284.0,479,33,25795,339,57.83,,,82,111,,,143.0,0.0,367.0,341,61,13122,191,46.86,,,19,94,,,109.0,0.0,17.0,17,4,381,48,29.3,323,117.95,0,0,43,2,4.0,0.0,27.0,25,974,412,15,Mar-42,Jun-92,27.46,2.53,64.9,0,0,0,117.0,62,1793,1445,52,04-Jul,04-Jul,27.78,4.83,34.4,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,284.0,,9458,4540,130,Apr-35,,34.92,2.88,72.7,,0,0,367.0,,6371,4767,172,04-Jul,04-Jul,27.71,4.48,37,2,0,0,17.0,13,228,256,11,Mar-19,Mar-19,23.27,6.73,20.7,0,0,0

Lee renewed his claims to a more permanent position in the Australian side with an excellent 1999-2000 one-day international campaign on home soil, where the focus increasingly turned to his accurate, intelligent bowling.

Fast and with a flashy smile that added to his star quality, he finished as Australia's fourth-most successful bowler with 310 wickets in 76 matches. A refusal to bow to severe injuries increases his rating, but for most of his career he operated as brutal support for Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. In his final two years he was a highly dependable attack leader until his body limited his ability to back up in five-day contests. \n"", 'At his best he gained outswing with the new ball and reverse with the older one, making him even more difficult for batsmen trying to steady themselves while knowing he could reach 160kph. The charging run-up and leaping celebrations added to the theatre for a bowler who made an instant impact when taking five wickets on debut at the MCG. Forty-two victims came in his opening seven Tests to gain him an A-list reputation, but he was soon in rehabilitation after an elbow operation. His ankles were a popular site for surgery and there were also side strains and stress fractures in a familiar cycle of breath-taking pace, painful injury and long-term layoff.', ""After starting by shaking up batsmen with short balls and yorkers, Lee became a smarter operator under Ricky Ponting's captaincy and knew when to deliver a burst of speed or a containing spell. In nine Tests following McGrath's departure, Lee stood up with 58 victims at 21.55 and also won the Allan Border Medal in 2008. During that period he helped keep the rebuilding side on top of the world. "", ""Life soon became harder again and after returning from more ankle surgery - his last act in a Test was limping off the MCG with a broken foot - he missed the 2009 Ashes with a side strain. England wasn't a kind host for Lee, who was consoled by Andrew Flintoff during his absorbing yet heart-breaking batting near-miss in Edgbaston in 2005. He was a courageous run-maker who would deflect or absorb the efforts of opposing fast men as they searched for payback."", 'A gentleman off the field, he was aggressive on it and rarely went over the top in comparison to his team-mates, although his bouncers at the tail-enders were uncomfortable viewing. Mostly he was a shining example to young players in all forms of the game. He retired from Tests at the beginning of 2010 to prolong his career in the shorter forms: in those affairs he could stay true to himself by attempting to operate at optimum speed while reducing the load on his aching body.

Much later, Mike Atherton compared McGrath to Ambrose on a vaster scale. Catapulted from the outback of New South Wales into Test cricket to replace Merv Hughes in 1993, McGrath became the greatest Australian fast bowler of his time. He went on to beat Courtney Walsh\'s 519 wickets in the 2005 Super Test to become the leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers and his claim to the title of Australia\'s greatest fast man is contested only by Dennis Lillee. His obituary was prepared a few times - he was doubted after coming back in 2004 from ankle surgery and there were similar fears following a long lay-off to care for his wife two years later - but he wrote his own farewells. He retired from Tests at the SCG - his home ground - after Australia whitewashed England 5-0 in the 2006-07 Ashes and was adjudged the Man of the Tournament during Australia\'s successful World Cup campaign in 2007, his final one-day appearance. \n', ""McGrath's USP was an unremitting off-stump line and an immaculate length. He gained off-cut and bounce, specialised in the opposition's biggest wickets - especially Atherton's and Brian Lara's - and he was unafraid to back himself publicly in these key duels. He was a batting rabbit who applied himself so intently that while playing for Worcestershire he won a bet with an Australian team-mate by scoring a fifty. The hard work eventually paid off in Tests, when he made 61, then the third-highest score by a No. 11, against New Zealand in 2004-05. Only in his occasional fits of ill-temper did he fail himself. "", ""He rewrote the World Cup record-books in 2003 with 7 for 15 against the outclassed Namibians, on his way to adding another winner's medal to a bulging collection. An ankle injury threatened to derail his quest for 500 Test wickets, but after briefly contemplating retirement he bounced back with yet another five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka at Darwin in July 2004. Three months later, at Nagpur, he became the first fast bowler to play 100 matches in the baggy green, and his greatness was further confirmed when knocking down the brittle Pakistanis at Perth with 8 for 24, the second-best figures by an Australian. "", ""Adept at picking his moments, he chose the first day at Lord's to reach 500 and his subsequent ankle and arm injuries were crucial to Australia losing the Ashes in 2005. The following summer was also painfully disrupted with the recurrence of his wife Jane's cancer, which called for immediate treatment and McGrath's full attention.

His misfortune was to play alongside Shane Warne in an age when Australia, the land of Grimmett and O'Reilly, paradoxically frowned on the concept of fielding two wrist-spinners at once. After showing they could work in tandem with 13 wickets against Pakistan at Sydney in 2005, MacGill hoped - almost pleaded - for more double-act opportunities. Playing seven matches in 2005-06, he dismantled the World XI with nine victims and accepted 16 wickets in the two-game series against Bangladesh. The following season, after injuring his knee on John Buchanan's boot camp, he didn't play a Test, but encouragement came when Warne left international cricket at the end of the Ashes. At 36, MacGill, who entered the ranks of grumpy older men when a 2006-07 argument with a grade umpire led to a two-match suspension, had the most reasons to be cheerful.  \n"", 'However, he struggled on his return to the Australia side against Sri Lanka in 2007 and was diagnosed with carpal-tunnel syndrome. His wrist required surgery and despite hard-working attempts to regain his previous powers, he knew in the West Indies he was no longer a bowler of international quality. Rather than hang around, he called it quits during the second Test in Antigua. In true MacGill style he stepped down with plaudits for his fine bowling contributions, honest personal reflections and a fine for sleeping in. ', ""MacGill stayed philosophical throughout his career, eagerly running in and invariably running amok. He bewitched 53 wickets in 11 Tests during Warne's 12-month drugs ban in 2003-04, yet was maligned for bowling one boundary-ball per over; a shade unfairly, considering that was the standard "", ' for all leggies pre-Warne. A batting duffer and increasingly feckless fielder, he played only three one-day internationals, winning the Man-of-the-Match award in one of them. Unusually for a bowler, MacGill seldom smiled upon taking a wicket. Instead he let out a roar of accomplishment. ""People ask me why I don\'t smile - it\'s because it\'s really hard,"" he said in 2003-04. ""Test cricket\'s hard ... I\'ll take a wicket and there\'ll be an explosion of emotion."" It was one of MacGill\'s many quirks. ', 'He is a wine connoisseur who has hosted a pay television show called ', "", and learned later in life to enjoy the taste of beer. The son and grandson of Western Australian state players, he socialised with friends who weren't cricketers in his playing days, and was often portrayed as a thinker, a misfit, the odd man out.

But the praise lavished on his decision to boycott Zimbabwe in 2004 because of moral concerns continued an unwelcome pattern: he long generated headlines for being "", ' of the Australian team rather than for his performances ', ' it.

Her ODI debut came in 2011 against England, and in only her second game, she scored an unbeaten 103, becoming at 18 years and 288 days old the youngest Australian - male or female - to score an international century. A year later, in an ODI against New Zealand, she broke the record for the fastest century by an Australian, racking up her ton in a mere 45 balls. \n', ""Recognised as having a great cricket brain, in January 2014 Lanning became the youngest ever captain of Australia (aged 21) mid-Ashes after an injury to Jodie Fields. She led from the front to finish as her side's top run-scorer in the series. In April that year she led her team to their third consecutive World Twenty20 title, putting up a ferocious performance with the bat: she hit 44 in the final, and in the group match against Ireland, in a breathtaking performance, she slammed 126 off 65 balls, the second highest score in all men's and women's T20Is. She finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer (with 257 runs at a strike rate of 158.6).

Or at least that's the perception: in a land of dashers and crashers Langer was seen as a grafter, a battler, only ever a couple of failures away from oblivion. The reality was  somewhat different. Yesteryear's ugly duckling turned into a stroke-playing swan, racking up more Test hundreds than those national treasures Doug Walters, Ian Chappell, Mark Waugh and Bill Lawry, and scoring an eye-popping 1481 runs in 2004. Always an effective cutter and driver, he indulged in unseemly crossbat hoicks from the first over. Together with his bludgeoning comrade Matthew Hayden, he screwed up textbooks and record-books alike, making Greenidge and Haynes look like strokeless stonewallers. It was a miraculous reinvention.  \n"", ""Clanged on the helmet by Ian Bishop on debut, Langer fought on to make 54, but played only eight Tests in six years. He returned at No. 3, as the selectors sought to mould him into the next David Boon - and for a while he exceeded even those lofty ambitions. After rescuing the unrescuable Hobart Test of 1999-2000 with Adam Gilchrist, then slaughtering a blistering 122 in Auckland, Steve Waugh called him the world's best batsman. The feeling was mutual; Langer's devotion to Waugh saw him nicknamed 'Mini-Tugga' alongside `JL' and `Alfie'. His bond with Hayden was even closer. The pair missed each other when they were apart, exchanged bear hugs in the middle, and gave the impression always of two boys living out a dream. "", ""Langer may be short of stature but he is tall in enthusiasm (he's already written two books) and boasts a black belt in taekwondo. His strong-willed performances were a highlight in a batting line-up that failed to fire against England in 2005, and with 394 runs at 43.77 he was Australia's leading scorer. He also took blows to the helmet and body, which are a common theme of his career. In a season disrupted by a cracked rib and a hamstring problem, Langer's 100th Test was delayed until the final match against South Africa in Johannesburg, where he turned into a Makhaya Ntini bouncer before scoring a run. Taken to hospital with a head cut and concussion, he spent the rest of the game in the hotel or dressing room and considered quitting altogether before placing the option below regaining the Ashes, and once that goal was achieved, he joined Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath in bowing out at the end of the series."", 'He played only eight one-day internationals, something that bugged him no end, despite a Gilchristian strike rate of 88.88.

He had impressed the selectors with his ability to prosper on difficult pitches - his offspin also helped his cause - and it was just reward for one of Western Australia's most reliable performers. Having started with a vital 117 as Australia's batsmen struggled in the opening match, he scored another 38 runs in three innings and picked up two wickets to show his part-time bowling value. Instead of appearing in the third Test, he spent the opening day sick in hospital, but stayed for the one-day series when Adam Voges pulled out. He also went to the United Arab Emirates via Hampshire to cover for Shaun Marsh, failing twice in the ODIs against Pakistan.  \n"", 'The 2009 Ashes was the series for his most accomplished performances at Test level, which included an unbeaten 125 in Cardiff and back-to-back returns of 96 and 110 in Birmingham and Leeds. He also had five scores of 12 or less to highlight his strange hit-and-miss tendency, and his life was made harder by being the main spinner in the decider at The Oval. Back in Australia for his first local Test experience, North was soon struggling and his position was in doubt after only 207 runs in six Tests against West Indies and Pakistan. ', 'Under immense pressure, he went to New Zealand, immediately fixed a damaging technical glitch and picked up 112, 9 and 90 in the two-Test series. ""It was a pretty defining couple of innings for my career,"" he said. However, he faltered again with the bat in the series against Pakistan in England, although he managed to get on the honour boards at Lord\'s with 6 for 55 in the second innings. ', ""A well-organised left-hander, North was afflicted by a casual attitude in his initial seasons with Western Australia as he made the transition from decorated youth player to senior squad member. He had significant success at under-age level, having been a member of several Academy and national junior sides and an elite scholar in 1998. He is particularly well remembered for a remarkable double of 200 and 134 at Sheikhupura during an Australian Youth team's tour of Pakistan in early 1997. His debut at first-class level came in 1998-99 on an Academy tour of Zimbabwe, and he quickly showcased his potential upon his elevation to senior interstate ranks the following season, hitting a brave 60 to help his team to a tense win over South Australia. "", ""For several years he rode an outstanding form streak, which began in 2003-04 with 984 runs in the Pura Cup and a century against Zimbabwe for Australia A. He followed with Pura Cup tallies of 826, 712 and 680 before a knee problem struck. Often a dangerous one-day player as well, North blasted 115 from 85 balls in a limited-overs game against Tasmania in 2006-07. North's special talents were recognised by Western Australia when he was handed the state's captaincy for 2007-08, only to miss much of the season with a degenerative knee condition. It was January before he could actually take up the on-field leadership and his Pura Cup campaign was limited to 184 runs at 26.28 from four games.

In three seasons leading up to a disrupted 2008-09, he rediscovered the penetration that earned early comparisons with Glenn McGrath, and heavy contributions with bat and ball led to national Twenty20 and ODI debuts in 2007-08. While his first international act was to be run-out without facing a ball against New Zealand, he returned to capture 3 for 18 and played the second Twenty20 of the summer against India. Staying with the squad for the opening match of the CB Series, he overcame a nervous first over to collect 1 for 46 in front of his home supporters at the Gabba.  \n"", ""A place in the Test squad for the West Indies followed, but he was not called to make his debut and then missed a spot on the India tour. The next summer was stalled by a nagging hip injury, which led to nine games for Queensland and a lost national contract. When offered a reduced deal for 2009-10 by the state, which no longer viewed him as a first-choice limited-overs player, he took up a two-year appointment with Western Australia. His first summer with the Warriors was mixed; he topped their FR Cup wicket tally with 10 at 24.40, but in the Sheffield Shield his 10 at 52.20 was a disappointing result. In his last uninterrupted season with Queensland he had collected 51 first-class wickets and scored 741 runs, making him the third Australian behind George Giffen and Greg Matthews to capture the 50-wicket, 500-run season double. Nobody in either discipline could match Noffke at Queensland as he tried to drag them off the bottom of the Pura Cup table, and he was recognised as the country's State Player of the Year. "", ""It was a satisfying set of jumps after he struggled between 2003 and 2005 with back and ankle problems that sat next to inflated averages. Hoping to enjoy endless summers, he seemed to suffer from off-season stints with Middlesex and Durham that twice ended in early flights home. Noffke's Ashes experience also finished in the same way after he rolled his ankle attempting a soccer-style run-out in the tour match against Sussex. It was a painful conclusion to an encouraging trip of three games, but he lost his national contract the following year before recapturing it with 41 first-class victims at 22.65 in 2002-03. The return gained him a second tour with the Australians, and he played two games in the West Indies on the way to re-joining Middlesex and picking up a back problem. There were some difficult years before Noffke earned a recall to Australia A colours in 2006-07 for a trip to Pakistan. His 30 Pura Cup wickets at 24.30 were complemented by two half-centuries and a strong FR Cup campaign led to the Queensland Player of the Year prize and a spot in Australia's preliminary Twenty20 world championship squad. "", ""Hailing from the Sunshine Coast, Noffke bowls with good rhythm from a high, clean and uncomplicated action and develops excellent pace through most of his spells. The Bulls' wealth of riches in the pace bowling department ensured it was not until 2000-01 that he made a real mark at interstate level. Man-of-the-Match performances in the opening game of the summer's Mercantile Mutual Cup program and the Pura Cup final, when he mixed 43 as nightwatchman with seven wickets for the game, headlined his rise. A former Academy associate scholarship holder, Noffke was the leading wicket taker in Brisbane grade cricket in both 1997-98 and 1998-99 and the Queensland Academy of Sport Player of the Year in 1998-99. To add to his skills with the ball, he spent a lot of time developing his lower-order batting, and in 2003-04 raised his maiden first-class century with 114 not out against South Australia. Noffke uses the lessons learned through a business degree to help his growing property interests.

Instead, he turned out for Netherlands (he is the son of Dutch migrant parents and carries a Dutch passport) and was part of the side that shocked England in the tournament opener. Though he went wicketless in that game, he was soon on Australia's radar, making his debut in an ODI against Scotland at Edinburgh.

It takes an extremely critical eye to diminish his run-scoring achievements, which seem to collect new records in every series. Like spotting a celebrity, it's necessary to look twice when analysing Ponting, first as the archetypal modern batsman, then as the country's 42nd Test captain. There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard, but his leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign. While his blade has sparkled, his stewardship is pock-marked by three  Ashes defeats - two in England and one at home - and stumbles to South Africa and India.  \n"", ""Those results didn't stop him from becoming the most successful captain in Test history after passing Steve Waugh's 41 wins in the 2009-10 Boxing Day Test. In the same match he overtook Shane Warne's 92 victories as the most by an individual, and he led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated (completed) World Cup games. He stepped down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to decide much tactically, but once that group headed for retirement he had to change from a manager to moulder. "", ""As a batsman the only debate is where to rank him in the high reaches of the game's greatest run-makers. Acclaimed by Academy coach Rod Marsh as the best teenage batsman he had ever seen, Ponting began with Tasmania at 17 and Australia at 20, and was given out unluckily for 96 on his Test debut. There were some teething problems, including a public admission of an alcohol problem, but the longer he went on the more he matured, building up records and runs. "", ""He plays all the shots with a full flourish of the bat - the cover drive and the pull are particularly productive methods - and knows only to attack. His breathtaking, dead-eye fielding is a force in the game by itself. Only Sachin Tendulkar has more centuries in Tests and ODIs combined than Ponting, who is a natural in the game's traditional forms, but resistant to the perks of Twenty20, from which he retired from in 2009. There have been setbacks against probing seam attacks, high-class finger-spin and, latterly, short balls, which he insists are meant to be pulled or hooked.

Initially, it was her bowling that proved her stronger suit, and she picked up her maiden five-wicket haul in an ODI against New Zealand in February 2010. Three months later, she was Australia's leading wicket-taker at the Women's World T20 in the Caribbean. That included a Player-of-the-Match-winning performance in the final, where her three wickets helped restrict New Zealand in a thrilling run chase and crown Australia world champions. She went on to play a vital role in all of Australia's four World Cup victories in as many years, though she will forever be remembered for the 2013 Women's World Cup final against West Indies, when, barely able to walk, she limped in to bowl 10 overs and took 3 for 19."", 'More recently, Perry proved her credentials as a genuine allrounder in back-to-back Ashes series.

Paine originally broke his right index finger in November 2010, when he was struck on the hand by a Dirk Nannes delivery while batting in an Australian Cricketers' Association All-Stars T20 match, and it caused him considerable problems over the next few years. It was extremely unfortunate timing for Paine, who had played four Tests earlier in 2010 against Pakistan and India while Haddin recovered from an elbow injury. On the India tour especially, Paine had shown impressive ability with the bat, scoring 92 and 59, but his own injury problems led to Matthew Wade jumping him in the queue to become the new second-in-line to Haddin. Although Paine subsequently appeared in a few ODIs and T20s, he spent nearly six years out of the national set-up before being recalled in February 2017 for a T20 series against Sri Lanka. \n"", ""It had looked as though Paine would perhaps never play for Australia again, for at times, as his career progressed, he was not even the first-choice gloveman for Tasmania. In first-class cricket he suffered from a lack of hundreds - in fact, the 215 that he scored while playing as a specialist batsman in his fifth Sheffield Shield game, back in October 2006, remained his only first-class century. It was quite remarkable for a player with such talent, although Paine was often a fine domestic contributor and played in Tasmania's triumphant Sheffield Shield finals in 2006-07 and 2012-13. He had also played in two successful domestic one-day finals for the Tigers, and was Man of the Match in the 2009-10 final when he opened the batting and scored 100. A respected leader who often captained Tasmania, Paine also led the Hobart Hurricanes, and it was ultimately through T20 that his return to international cricket finally arrived."", 'The composure Paine showed in the shortest form, combined with the underwhelming contributions of Peter Nevill and Matthew Wade, led selectors to think laterally ahead of the 2017-18 Ashes, in which his selection was the most surprising and indeed contentious. But he performed admirably as part of a winning team, and then found himself thrust into the centre of things on the subsequent South Africa tour. He was initially the man who separated David Warner from Quinton de Kock in the Durban stairwell, then the man who replaced Steven Smith as captain the morning after the Newlands ball-tampering fiasco.

He saved his loudest grunt for his batting, where he was that rarest of modern-day creatures - an unabashed six-hitter in the mould of a George Bonnor or a Colin Milburn or a David Hookes. Batting for Gloucestershire at 20, he scythed 16 sixes in the first dig [a world record] against Glamorgan at Abergavenny, 20 for the match [another first], and then announced he couldn't care less about the milestone; he wanted only to help his team. His flaw was to attempt one six too many - invariably off the wrong ball - and get mixed up in off-field troubles.  \n"", '""I used to hate watching him bat,"" his old coach Toot Byron once lamented. ""He wasn\'t in control of his shot-selection ... he\'d get 24 off an over and then go out on the last ball of that over."" Legend has it that Symonds, a Queensland larrikin who shaved his dreadlocks early in 2009, once turned up barefoot and wearing a cowboy hat for a contract meeting with Cricket Australia\'s then-chief executive Malcolm Speed. He also ruled himself ineligible for any award at the 2006 Allan Border Medal - he would have been the One-Day Player of the Year - after being suspended for turning up drunk before Australia\'s embarrassing loss to Bangladesh on the 2005 Ashes tour. ', 'During almost five years in and out of the one-day side he frittered away golden opportunities galore. One day changed everything. Striding out with his team in turmoil against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup, a game and tournament he never expected to play in, Symonds sculpted a masterly 143 not out in 125 balls. Until that day, he had mustered just 762 one-day runs at only 23; after that he averaged more than 43 and became a hero to those who adored his clumping style. ""In the past,"" he admitted, ""I was a man without a map when I went out to bat."" He grew to understand his one-day role perfectly - he could have claimed to be the side\'s most valuable player after pounding three hundreds and taking 21 wickets in 2005-06. His impact to the limited-overs outfit was shown the following season after he ripped a tendon from his arm playing a fierce drive. Without him the team struggled to its worst losing streak in a decade. Symonds proved he was an incredibly quick healer by entering the World Cup mid-tournament and was part of his second consecutive triumph. ', ""Born in Birmingham, Symonds could have played for England but dreamed only of wearing the baggy green. In 2004 his fantasy was fulfilled in decidedly unGabbalike surroundings: the crackling minefields of Sri Lanka. He batted gamely without looking altogether comfortable, and was dumped after two Tests. Almost two years later he received an extended run as Australia's selectors searched for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, but he couldn't consistently mirror his one-day performances. Faced with the axe, he cracked a huge six at the MCG to open his scoring in a pressure-relieving 72 from 54 balls, which included a ground-record five maximums, but was dropped on the Bangladesh tour after struggling for reliable impact in the previous series against South Africa. Given another opportunity when Shane Watson was injured and Damien Martyn retired, he appeared in his first Ashes series and reached a career high in his second game with 156 at the MCG. Batting with his fishing friend Matthew Hayden, he showed he had the mindset to make it. "", 'The 2007-08 campaign was easily his best, with 777 runs in nine Tests against Sri Lanka, India and West Indies. The high was an unbeaten 162 in the first innings at the SCG, which was quickly followed by the low of a lengthy race row involving Harbhajan Singh. The problems did not prevent him becoming the most popular overseas player at the Indian Premier League auction, where he sold for US$1.35m, and he had four games with the Deccan Chargers. After the tournament he switched back into five-day mode and a pair of half-centuries in the tight opening contest with West Indies showed his growing batting maturity and sense of security at Test level. By the end of the campaign his average was a respectable 44.65. ', 'However, his off-field attitude continued to be a problem and the last straw came when he went fishing in Darwin when he should have been at a team meeting in the lead-up to an ODI series against Bangladesh. Symonds was sent home from the series and not picked for the tour of India in late 2008. He was rushed back in Australia and was involved in a pub scuffle while celebrating the first Test win, and he appeared in three more matches before undergoing knee surgery.

Smith's talent was apparent early, but as a young batsman he had more moving parts than an orchestra, only they didn't always work in harmony. He went away and worked on his game and returned to the Test side two years later with a much tighter technique. He still fidgeted between balls but could play every shot in the book, and a few more that defied words besides. Smith is quick-footed and adept at facing spin, but is equally comfortable driving and pulling the fast bowlers. His first Test century came at The Oval in the 2013 Ashes and his composure was apparent in the way he brought up the milestone with a six safely lofted down the ground. Over the next year he continued to improve and 2014-15 became the Summer of Steve, as he scored centuries in all four first innings of the home Tests against India. \n"", ""\nIt was also in the 2014-15 home summer that he became Australia's 45th Test captain, filling in for the injured Michael Clarke in three Tests. Despite being only 25 at the time his maturity in the role was evident, and the extra responsibility clearly didn't hamper his run-making. It became clear that Smith was to be Clarke's successor, a move that was confirmed after Clarke's retirement at the end of the 2015 Ashes in England. It was also clear that Smith had become the most important batsman in Australia's team; his 215 in the win at Lord's came after a promotion up the order to No.3. As Smith's batting developed his bowling became less frequently sighted, although he could still land the odd fizzing legbreak and winkle out a wicket or two. In the field Smith's athleticism and instinct stands out, even in a high quality fielding side like Australia. He has also become a key man in Australia's ODI side, and was his country's leading run scorer in their triumphant 2015 World Cup campaign.""]","['Allan Border Medal - 2015', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2015', 'Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2015', 'ICC Player of the Year - 2015', 'ICC Test Player of the Year - 2015']",64.0,117,16,6199,239,61.37,11171,55.49,23,24,684,36,96.0,0.0,108.0,94,12,3431,164,41.84,3973,86.35,8,19,289,31,62.0,0.0,30.0,25,5,431,90,21.55,352,122.44,0,2,34,11,18.0,0.0,118.0,208,26,10424,239,57.27,18176,57.35,37,44,1217,81,174.0,0.0,154.0,138,23,5226,164,45.44,5992,87.21,10,32,428,70,91.0,0.0,164.0,145,32,3325,101,29.42,2659,125.04,1,12,287,77,91.0,0.0,64.0,49,1339,933,17,Mar-18,Apr-83,54.88,4.18,78.7,0,0,0,108.0,36,1046,931,27,Mar-16,Mar-16,34.48,5.34,38.7,0,0,0,30.0,17,291,377,17,Mar-20,Mar-20,22.17,7.77,17.1,0,0,0,118.0,112,5057,3542,67,Jul-64,8/169,52.86,4.2,75.4,2,1,0,154.0,64,1988,1784,46,Mar-16,Mar-16,38.78,5.38,43.2,0,0,0,164.0,52,824,1056,54,Apr-13,Apr-13,19.55,7.68,15.2,2,0,0

A hard-working, hostile fast bowler who has not always been viewed as the epitome of subtlety, Siddle has been used as an enforcer, a workhorse and at times as the spearhead of Australia's bowling group. But he is also a man of contradictions, a tough rural Victorian who was a competitive woodchopper in his youth, yet since 2012 a vegan whose diet can consist of 15 to 20 bananas a day. Such a diet would hardly have appealed to Merv Hughes, a fellow Victorian who filled a similar role in Australia's team in the 1980s and 90s and, like Siddle since 2010, was largely considered a Test-match specialist. \n"", 'First picked for the tour of India in 2008-09, Siddle made his Test debut in Mohali and hit Gautam Gambhir in the head with his first ball, before claiming Sachin Tendulkar as his maiden Test wicket. Solid performances in the back-to-back series against South Africa confirmed his place in the side and he was a committed figure during the 2009 Ashes tour - loud and brash on the field and calm off it - and a first-innings 5 for 21 in Leeds helped him to 20 wickets. In October of that year, he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year, but a quiet home Test summer was followed by a stress fracture in his back, which required lengthy rehabilitation.', ""His comeback could hardly have been more memorable. At the Gabba on the opening day of the 2010-11 Ashes series, Siddle celebrated his 26th birthday by becoming the ninth Australian to take a Test hat-trick, his yorker at Stuart Broad's toes leading to a typically animated, and successful, lbw appeal. The series was a fiasco for Australia, but Siddle at least managed to collect 6 for 75 on his home ground at the MCG, even if Australia were crushed in the match. The following summer he bowled with more pace, swing and accuracy and collected 23 wickets at 18.65 in the 4-0 thrashing of India, and was Man of the Match in the final Test in Adelaide after taking 5 for 49 in the first innings on a good batting pitch."", 'Adelaide again proved eventful for Siddle the next season. After flying home from the 2012 tour of the West Indies with a back injury, Siddle returned to the side against South Africa and his energy levels under his new diet were tested to the maximum at Adelaide Oval. The loss of James Pattinson mid-match to an injury left Siddle with a huge workload; he sent down 63.5 overs in the Test, the most by an Australian fast bowler this century. By the closing stages of day five with Australia seeking two wickets to win, Siddle was down on his haunches between balls, exhausted and, he later admitted, ""a little bit delirious"". Siddle claimed four wickets in the innings but South Africa held on for a draw, and the workload led to Siddle missing the next Test. When he returned for the first Test against Sri Lanka, he responded with a career best match haul of 9 for 104.', ""Siddle struggled for impact on Australia's hopeless 2012-13 tour of India but was typically persistent and reliable in the back-to-back Ashes campaigns in 2013-14. He showed intelligence in his use of the crease to add variety and his ability to build pressure on England's batsmen with consistent lines and lengths made him an important, if under-rated, member of the attack. But a preference for out-and-out pace from the selectors led to Siddle losing his spot in the team during the tour of South Africa in early 2014, and he was asked to work on regaining the yard of speed he had lost. "", 'Siddle grew up in Morwell in rural Victoria and was already a promising competitive woodchopper when he eventually took up cricket at 14. He became a successful youth player whose honours included taking 11 for 47 in a state under-17 match, breaking the long-standing record of John Scholes, the late Victoria coach. Injuries hampered his early domestic career, with a shoulder reconstruction sidelining him for most of 2006-07 and further shoulder problems troubling him the following season.\n']",['ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2009'],64.0,90,14,1080,51,14.21,2295,47.05,0,2,116,4,17.0,0.0,20.0,6,3,31,10*,10.33,30,103.33,0,0,2,0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,1,1*,-,1,100,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,158.0,212,37,2893,103*,16.53,5721,50.56,1,5,304,18,50.0,0.0,55.0,29,10,240,62,12.63,242,99.17,0,1,24,4,6.0,0.0,46.0,14,9,31,9*,6.2,37,83.78,0,0,2,1,9.0,0.0,64.0,120,13325,6482,214,Jun-54,9/104,30.28,2.91,62.2,8,8,0,20.0,19,901,743,17,Mar-55,Mar-55,43.7,4.94,53,0,0,0,2.0,2,48,58,3,Feb-24,Feb-24,19.33,7.25,16,0,0,0,158.0,291,30398,14845,535,Aug-54,Sep-77,27.74,2.93,56.8,22,20,0,55.0,54,2764,2140,59,Apr-27,Apr-27,36.27,4.64,46.8,1,0,0,46.0,45,936,1143,40,Apr-29,Apr-29,28.57,7.32,23.4,1,0,0

A brutal bowler with a shoulder-strong action, Tait's body found the workload too tough in the long form and played only three Tests, and was done with first-class cricket by the age of 25.  \n"", ""In January 2008 he took an indefinite break from the game due to physical and emotional exhaustion and focused on one-dayers and T20s when he returned later that year. As a late addition to Australia's one-day squad in 2010, he unleashed a ball against England at Lord's that registered at 161.1kph, the second-fastest of all-time, but it was the consistent push for speed that crippled him regularly. "", 'With a muscular and unrefined method that seemed to invite pain, Tait played a significant role in Australia\'s World Cup triumph in the Caribbean in 2007, where he claimed 23 wickets; only Glenn McGrath took more throughout the tournament. He was back in the West Indies three years later when Australia reached the World T20 final, and was a key component in their pace-heavy but unsuccessful World Cup campaign in the subcontinent in 2011. That looked set to be his international swansong as he retired from ODIs straight afterwards and quit state cricket later that year, but he remained active in the Big Bash League. Five years later, he was back in Australia\'s T20 team after a surprising recall in the lead-up to the 2016 World T20. But that was the last we saw of Tait on the international circuit: he retired - from all forms of the game - the following March, saying it all came down to his injury issues again. ""The elbow has gone off a cliff now,"" he said.', ""The Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year back in the day in 2003-04, Tait also picked up the ING Cup's Best New Talent prize, chiefly for his 8 for 43 against Tasmania, the most impressive figures in domestic limited-overs history. He was included in the 2005 Ashes tour, where he played two Tests ahead of his more celebrated South Australia team-mate Jason Gillespie, but his action was unsustainable in the long form. An abbreviated 2005-06 included 6 for 41 in the ING Cup final - an amazing combination of spot-on speed and 14 wides. Still, when on song, his old-fashioned approach of yorkers and bumpers mixed with a modern dose of sharp reverse-swing caused huge excitement for everyone but the batsmen. A child of the Adelaide Hills, he received his best advice at the age of seven when his father suggested he play cricket.\n""]","['Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2004', 'ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2007']",3.0,5,2,20,8,6.66,46,43.47,0,0,4,0,1.0,0.0,35.0,7,5,25,11,12.5,29,86.2,0,0,3,1,8.0,0.0,21.0,6,2,11,6,2.75,15,73.33,0,0,0,1,3.0,0.0,50.0,70,29,509,68,12.41,991,51.36,0,2,,,15.0,0.0,101.0,38,20,110,22*,6.11,179,61.45,0,0,,,23.0,0.0,171.0,53,25,163,26,5.82,201,81.09,0,0,8,7,24.0,0.0,3.0,6,414,302,5,Mar-97,3/121,60.4,4.37,82.8,0,0,0,35.0,34,1688,1461,62,Apr-39,Apr-39,23.56,5.19,27.2,2,0,0,21.0,21,478,589,28,Mar-13,Mar-13,21.03,7.39,17,0,0,0,50.0,,9263,5661,198,Jul-29,,28.59,3.66,46.7,17,7,1,101.0,,5063,4340,182,Aug-43,Aug-43,23.84,5.14,27.8,6,3,0,171.0,167,3674,4891,218,May-32,May-32,22.43,7.98,16.8,3,1,0

However, it was a move to Western Australia at the start of the 1999-2000 season that ensured he ultimately moved in the right direction and became a revitalised bowler. Taking 50 wickets in his debut first-class campaign with the Warriors, he enjoyed a purple patch and in 2001-02 was called up to the national one-day squad.  \n', ""In four Tests against Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka he collected nine victims to put alongside 35 in 25 one-day appearances.

His unbeaten 130 against West Indies in Dominica also ensured that he would be part of Australia's starting XI for the 2015 Ashes series that followed, and although he struggled for impact in the first three Tests, he managed a pair of fifties towards the end of Australia's unsuccessful campaign.  \n"", ""\nNot only did Voges retain the faith of the selectors, after the post-Ashes retirements of Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin, he was even made vice-captain to Steven Smith for the Test tour of Bangladesh in the absence of the newly-appointed vice-captain David Warner due to injury. Security concerns led to that series being postponed, but Voges made up for the lost opportunity by scoring 269*, 106* and 239 in three innings against West Indies and New Zealand in the 2015-16 season. He retired from international cricket on Valentine's Day 2017 - with an average of 61.87, the second highest for anyone after Donald Bradman among those to have played 20 matches - and then from domestic cricket a month later. "", ""\nVoges' promotion to the Test side came after a remarkable 2014-15 season in which he plundered 1358 runs at 104.46 in the Sheffield Shield, including six centuries from 11 matches. His numbers were so impressive that the selectors could not ignore him for the tour of the West Indies in 2015, nearly nine years after he had first been part of an Australian Test squad. In 2006-07 he was a surprise inclusion after the mid-Ashes retirement of Damien Martyn, but Voges did not debut during that series and until his mid-30s had to settle for being an ODI and T20 international cricketer. Even in those formats he was never really a fixture in the side, although there might have been a few more appearances had he not chosen to get married rather than joining Australia on their tour of South Africa in 2009. As it happened, it took him more than six years to reach 30 one-day internationals, despite averaging in the mid- to high-40s when given the chance. "", ""\nVoges had originally made his name with a 62-ball century in 2004-05, which was then the fastest in Australia's domestic one-day history. Not only did he break a record, he also clattered a sponsor's sign with one of seven sixes. Voges collected many plaudits for the innings and a $50,000 bonus for superb aim. He was named captain of Western Australia in 2012 having often filled the role previously in a stand-in capacity and was a semi-regular county cricketer during the off-season. Voges has played for Nottinghamshire, Middlesex and Hampshire. An effective T20 striker and athletic fieldsman, Voges has played in the IPL and the Caribbean Premier League, and captained the Perth Scorchers to the BBL title in 2014-15.\n"", '\n', ' \n']",['Australian Domestic Player of the Year - 2016'],20.0,31,7,1485,269*,61.87,2667,55.68,5,4,186,5,15.0,0.0,31.0,28,9,870,112*,45.78,998,87.17,1,4,61,10,7.0,0.0,7.0,5,2,139,51,46.33,114,121.92,0,1,8,2,3.0,0.0,211.0,351,52,13881,269*,46.42,27075,51.26,32,72,,,282.0,0.0,191.0,183,42,6130,112*,43.47,7700,79.61,5,47,,,80.0,0.0,180.0,168,37,4064,82*,31.02,3203,126.88,0,19,343,67,71.0,0.0,20.0,6,76,44,0,-,-,-,3.47,-,0,0,0,31.0,15,301,276,6,01-Mar,01-Mar,46,5.5,50.1,0,0,0,7.0,1,12,5,2,02-May,02-May,2.5,2.5,6,0,0,0,211.0,,3770,2021,56,Apr-92,,36.08,3.21,67.3,2,0,0,191.0,,1881,1604,39,Mar-20,Mar-20,41.12,5.11,48.2,0,0,0,180.0,56,566,754,27,02-Apr,02-Apr,27.92,7.99,20.9,0,0,0

At the start of his career it was hard to know whether he would develop into a nagging legspinner, aggressive middle-order batsman, intuitive skipper, or a bit of all three. After being tried as a Test leggie in India in 2008, it became apparent that batting was his focus and he developed into a destructive stroke-maker in the shorter formats. His maturity was recognised when he was named as Australia's Twenty20 captain in 2011. The appointment lasted only a year due to his batting form but it was a natural fit, for he had nearly a decade of captaincy experience having led Victoria in 2003-04 at the age of 20. The youngest skipper in their history, he won rave reviews for his cool head and warm handling of more hardened contemporaries. For all that, he remained a largely unassuming country lad. Picked to tour Zimbabwe when Stuart MacGill withdrew for moral reasons, White cancelled a fishing trip to attend the press conference then boyishly shrugged aside questions about the circumstances of his selection. He was chosen as much for his no-frills batting as his bowling; David Hookes, the late Victorian coach, felt White's best chance of representing Australia was to earn a top-six spot. \n"", 'White first emerged as a peculiarly unAustralian-style legspinner, tall and robust, relying on changes of pace and a handy wrong\'un rather than prodigious turn or flight. He would even start a spell with an offspinner or quicker ball. As far back as December 2002 his hero Shane Warne had predicted: ""I think he\'s a [future] Australian player provided he sticks to the way he plays and doesn\'t try to be someone different."" White made his ODI debut during the Super Series a year after missing a first Test cap when Nathan Hauritz was preferred in India. The retirement of Brad Hogg in early 2008 opened up an ODI spin position and White was given the first chance to secure the role. He even won a call-up to the Test squad in India when Victoria\'s first-choice leggie Bryce McGain went down with a shoulder injury. Despite his discomfort at being the No. 1 spinner, he held firm on debut while facing the best players of slow bowling in the business. As the series wore on it became clear he was not the answer to Australia\'s troubles and after four matches he was shifted aside with five wickets and 146 runs. It was time to try again as a batsman.', 'A clean striker of the ball who plundered ten centuries in two seasons of county cricket in 2006 and 2007, White has at times strangely struggled to convert his good starts into first-class hundreds back home. He did score 135 in the 2008-09 Sheffield Shield final against Queensland, though, and was relieved to lift the trophy after a series of near misses. He burst to life in 2009 with his first ODI century, 105 against England in Southampton, and another century came against Pakistan at home. White disappeared from the ODI side after being part of the 2011 World Cup squad but re-emerged in the T20 outfit in 2014 ahead of the World T20 in Bangladesh. The loss of the state captaincy to Matthew Wade for 2013-14 coincided with a strong personal campaign of 675 runs at 45.00, and any future internationals will certainly be as a batsman.\n', '\n']",['Australian Domestic Player of the Year - 2014'],4.0,7,2,146,46,29.2,330,44.24,0,0,15,1,1.0,0.0,91.0,77,16,2072,105,33.96,2586,80.12,2,11,145,45,37.0,0.0,47.0,44,14,984,85*,32.8,740,132.97,0,5,71,44,23.0,0.0,176.0,297,35,10494,260*,40.05,,,22,55,,,205.0,0.0,269.0,240,35,7703,165,37.57,9662,79.72,13,45,,,123.0,0.0,234.0,225,50,5433,141*,31.04,4290,126.64,2,35,378,227,96.0,0.0,4.0,8,558,342,5,Feb-71,3/119,68.4,3.67,111.6,0,0,0,91.0,19,331,351,12,03-May,03-May,29.25,6.36,27.5,0,0,0,47.0,5,42,51,1,01-Nov,01-Nov,51,7.28,42,0,0,0,176.0,,13754,8069,195,Jun-66,,41.37,3.51,70.5,,3,1,269.0,,4136,3729,104,Apr-15,Apr-15,35.85,5.4,39.7,4,0,0,234.0,42,484,708,26,04-Oct,04-Oct,27.23,8.77,18.6,1,0,0

He led Australia in 15 of their world-record 16 consecutive Test wins and to the 1999 World Cup title, playing 168 Tests and collecting 10,927 runs on the way ","['\nSteve Waugh is the ultimate evolved cricketer. Thrown to the wolves at 20, he flailed at all bowling, sent down bouncers at Viv Richards, and tasted Ashes defeat. Then he helped win a World Cup and made 393 runs before losing his wicket in England in 1989 - but admitted that he did not understand his own game, and 18 months later lost his place to his minutes-younger twin, Mark. It was his catharsis. Upon his recall, he minimalised his batsmanship, forgoing risk and waiting for the loose ball, which he still punished severely. He was all but forced to give up bowling by back problems. A series of epic innings ensued, none better than his 200 in Jamaica in 1994-95 to speed Australia to an historic series win, or his twin hundreds at Old Trafford to turn the 1997 Ashes series.  \n', ""He succeeded Mark Taylor as Test captain in 1999, and began with a torrid 2-2 draw in the Caribbean, but later led Australia boldly in 15 of their world-record 16 successive Test victories. With Shane Warne, he turned Australia's form around so completely in the 1999 World Cup that they won it, and he became (with Tom Moody) the first Australians to win the trophy twice. But he was denied the opportunity to defend his title when he was unceremoniously axed from the one-day side, like Taylor before him, following Australia's poor showing in the 2001-02 VB Series. He railed against his omission, but even he couldn't reverse it. "", ""He continued as Test captain, though, winning yet another Ashes series in 2002-03, and continuing (after frenzied debate) for the West Indian tour that followed Australia's 2003 World Cup win under Ricky Ponting. An inveterate sightseer, Waugh wrote a series of successful tour diaries, helped set up a charity for the daughters of lepers in Calcutta, and subscribed fervently to the power of the mind. At 36, he won the Allan Border Medal as Australia's best player of 2001.

Despite boasting an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson's frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He refused to give up. Not through recurrences of back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, a dislocated shoulder or a suspected heart attack that turned out to be food poisoning. He changed his training, preferring pilates to weights, gave up alcohol, but not his dream. It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson had become used to re-inventing himself. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG against Pakistan - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He had earned some luck. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals but by 2011-12, injury had again interceded. He returned to the Test team in 2012 but spent the rest of his career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own. \n"", ""\nIn 2013, Watson became Australia's 44th Test captain when he led the team to a three-day loss in Delhi in place of the injured Michael Clarke. It completed a hectic couple of weeks for Watson, who had been suspended from the previous Test in the homework saga and had also flown home for the birth of his child. He gave up the vice-captaincy after that tour and played for another two years before being dropped during the 2015 Ashes, after which he announced his retirement from Tests. As a bowler, Watson developed into one of Australia's best exponents of reverse swing, and if he was not claiming wickets himself he was often building pressure at one end. At times his bowling saved his place in the Test team, for four centuries from 59 Tests and an average of 35.19 was a little less than he desired as a batsman. At the crease he is an aggressive brute with a broad chest, a right-handed disciple of Matthew Hayden, and someone who often doesn't need to follow-through to gain a boundary. However, his drives and pulls are delivered in a much smoother style. Always a dangerous striker in the shorter formats, Watson clubbed Bangladesh for 185 in a 50-over contest in April 2011, the highest score ever by an Australian batsman in ODI cricket. The Player of the Tournament at the 2012 World T20, Watson retired from all international cricket at the end of the 2016 tournament.\n"", '\n']","['Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2002', 'Australian One-Day International Player of the Year - 2010,2011, 2012', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2011', 'Allan Border Medal - 2010,2011', 'Australian Twenty20 International Player of the Year - 2012, 2013']",59.0,109,3,3731,176,35.19,7094,52.59,4,24,483,31,45.0,0.0,190.0,169,27,5757,185*,40.54,6365,90.44,9,33,570,131,64.0,0.0,58.0,56,6,1462,124*,29.24,1006,145.32,1,10,115,83,20.0,0.0,137.0,241,19,9451,203*,42.57,,,20,54,,,109.0,0.0,265.0,241,36,7915,185*,38.6,9187,86.15,11,46,,,88.0,0.0,300.0,292,33,7784,124*,30.05,5595,139.12,6,45,677,411,86.0,0.0,59.0,93,5495,2526,75,Jun-33,Jun-51,33.68,2.75,73.2,1,3,0,190.0,163,6466,5342,168,Apr-36,Apr-36,31.79,4.95,38.4,3,0,0,58.0,49,930,1187,48,Apr-15,Apr-15,24.72,7.65,19.3,1,0,0,137.0,,12164,6294,210,Jul-69,,29.97,3.1,57.9,,7,1,265.0,,8406,7063,213,Apr-36,Apr-36,33.15,5.04,39.4,3,0,0,300.0,231,4429,5838,216,Apr-15,Apr-15,27.02,7.9,20.5,3,0,0

If his bat isn't doing the talking his mouth probably is, and either way you can expect an assertive approach. One of the most destructive hitters in world cricket, Warner opens for Australia in all three formats and in 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England's Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had also been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It also completed a remarkable rise for a man who burst on to the international scene in 2008-09 as a Twenty20 specialist; he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well. \n"", ""\nHis debut in the baggy green came, appropriately, in Test match No.2020, against New Zealand at the Gabba in 2011, and in his second match he achieved what Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden never did - he carried his bat through a Test innings. His unbeaten 123 in Hobart could not prevent a historic New Zealand win, but his patience in challenging conditions showed a different side to his batsmanship. Later in the same summer he made a very different kind of hundred, a 69-ball ton against India at the WACA that turned into a career-best 180. Over the next few years he became one of the most productive performers in Australia's Test order, and in 2014 he scored twin hundreds in the Cape Town Test against South Africa and then repeated the feat in Adelaide against India, in what was an especially emotional match as Australia returned to cricket following the death of Phillip Hughes. In one-day cricket Warner initially struggled to find the right tempo, but he was part of Australia's triumphant side in 2015 and made 45 against New Zealand in the final.\n""]","['Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year - 2012', 'Allan Border Medal - 2016', 'Australian Test Player of the Year - 2016']",74.0,137,5,6363,253,48.2,8540,74.5,21,29,765,55,54.0,0.0,106.0,104,4,4343,179,43.43,4498,96.55,14,17,454,70,49.0,0.0,70.0,70,3,1792,90*,26.74,1279,140.1,0,13,172,79,41.0,0.0,102.0,184,7,8608,253,48.63,11545,74.56,28,37,1055,75,68.0,0.0,151.0,149,6,6094,197,42.61,6209,98.14,19,22,627,127,67.0,0.0,259.0,258,28,8111,135*,35.26,5709,142.07,6,63,803,328,127.0,0.0,74.0,19,342,269,4,Feb-45,Feb-45,67.25,4.71,85.5,0,0,0,106.0,1,6,8,0,-,-,-,8,-,0,0,0,70.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,102.0,34,595,455,6,Feb-45,Feb-45,75.83,4.58,99.1,0,0,0,151.0,8,144,158,4,01-Nov,01-Nov,39.5,6.58,36,0,0,0,259.0,1,6,13,0,-,-,-,13,-,0,0,0

A charismatic, spectacular performer who made as headlines on the field and off it, he finished second-best to Muttiah Muralitharan in the Test wickets stakes, but to many he remains the greatest spinner - if not bowler - of them all.  ","['\nAt first there were nerves and chubbiness. Then came wild soaring legbreaks, followed by fame and flippers. For a long while there were women, then a bookmaker, then diet pills, then more women - and headlines, always headlines. Now he has come out the other end, his bluff and bluster and mischief and innocence somehow intact. The man who in 2000 was rated among the five greatest cricketers of the 20th century was, in 2006, bowling better than ever. \n', ""When Warne likened his life to a soap opera he was selling himself short. His story was part fairytale, part pantomime, part hospital drama, part adult's-only romp, part glittering awards ceremony. He took a Test hat-trick, won the Man-of-the-Match prize in a World Cup final and was the subject of seven books. He was the first cricketer to reach 700 Test wickets. He swatted more runs than any other Test player without making a hundred, and was probably the wiliest captain Australia never had. His ball that gazoodled Mike Gatting in 1993, bouncing outside leg stump and cuffing off, is unanimously esteemed the most famous in history. He revived legspin, thought to be extinct, and is now pre-eminent in a game so transformed that we sometimes wonder where the next champion fast bowlers will come from."", ""For all that, Warne's greatest feats are perhaps those of the last couple of years of his career. Returning in 2004 from a 12-month hiatus for swallowing forbidden diuretics, he swept aside 26 Sri Lankan batsmen in three Tests, and the following year scalped a world record 96 victims - a stunning 24 more than in his show-stopping 1993 - and still missed out on the Allan Border Medal. Forty of those were Englishmen in what sometimes appeared to be a lone stand in a thrilling Ashes series. At the end he was helped by his stockpile of straight balls: a zooter, slider, toppie and back-spinner, one that drifted in, one that sloped out, and another that didn't budge. Yet he seldom got his wrong'un right and rarely landed his flipper. More than ever he relied on his two oldest friends: excruciating accuracy and an exquisite legbreak, except that he controlled the degree of spin - and mixed it - at will. Like the great classical painters, he stumbled upon the art of simplicity. His bowling was never simpler, nor more effective, nor lovelier to look at."", ""Maybe, as with Posh Spice or Kylie Minogue, Warne is more famous than he is loved. Maybe we didn't fully appreciate his genius until he quit at the end of the 2006-07 Ashes series when he achieved his final goal, the reclaiming of the urn; maybe, like Bradman's, it will become ever more apparent with the passing of decades. One thing's for sure, though.

He was relentlessly competitive, invariably aggressive, and as hard and uncompromising as the new ball. After an international career that lasted almost 15 years, the end was desperately unfortunate, as Boucher was forced to announce his retirement after being hit in the eye by a bail in a warm-up game on the tour to England in 2012, which would have been his last series anyway. Boucher finished with 998 international dismissals as a wicketkeeper, including 555 in 147 Tests. \n', ""Boucher's start in international cricket was uncertain. His relative lack of pure wicketkeeping skill and ability was exposed on South Africa's 1998 tour to England when he was repeatedly undone by the swing of the ball after it had pitched. However, Boucher had no peer in terms of temperament, guts and determination, and he duly fashioned himself into one of the finest glovemen in the game. He could often be seen, long after the rest of the squad had hit the showers after a training session, willing himself through another set of wicketkeeping drills. The hard work paid off, and he is likely to hold the record for Test dismissals - among many others - long after his retirement. "", ""As a batsman Boucher lived for the big moment, the quick 30 or 40 his team needed to win a match, or the session that had to be spent at the crease to ensure a draw. His most memorable innings was probably the scintillating unbeaten 50 he scored to complete South Africa's surge to a series-clinching target of 438 for 9 off the penultimate ball of a one-day international against Australia in Johannesburg in March 2006. "", 'Boucher strutted through 75 consecutive Tests before the suits thought he needed to be brought down a peg or two and dropped him for the tour to India in 2004. His reality duly checked, he returned to the national team as the ultimate man for the trenches. In the autumn of his career, his renewed commitment to his conditioning earned him extra years at the top, and helped him become the first wicketkeeper to take 500 catches in Test cricket. ', 'For a man who loomed so large in the world of cricket, Boucher started small. He was invariably smaller, and younger, than anyone else in the age-group provincial teams he played in.

During the late 2000s, he was a regular in South Africa's ODI and T20I squads, though his brand of economical offspin bowling was considered too limited to make him a regular in the longer format - he has played only five Tests for South Africa. \n"", ""Botha's best suit is his offspin bowling: he is accurate, he varies his pace and length intelligently, and isn't afraid to bowl at any stage of an innings - attributes which made him a favourite in the limited-overs format. Between 2007 and 2011, Botha played 66 ODIs and took 64 wickets at an economy rate of 4.53. In the 2011 World Cup, he had a fine economy rate of 4.07 in the five matches he played. Before that, in 2009, he also led South Africa to an ODI series win against Australia in Australia in 2009."", ""However, throughout his career Botha has been plagued by question-marks about his bowling action. His action was cited on his Test debut in January 2006, and following testing at the University of Western Australia, he was banned by the ICC. Botha reworked his action but it was confirmed once again in September that he bent his arm more than 15 degrees. However, after another review in November, Botha's action was cleared by the ICC. More recently, he underwent biomechanical analysis and was cleared by Cricket Australia after being reported by the umpires in a domestic one-day match in October 2013."", 'Before Botha made his strides as a spinner, he was a medium pacer for the Eastern Cape Warriors - by his own admission he was quicker than 125 kmph. However, Mickey Arthur, the former South Africa coach, had a look at him in the nets and saw something else that Botha dropped his ambitions for speed. The move has served him well over a career that has lasted more than a decade.']",['South Africa Player of the Year 2008'],5.0,6,2,83,25,20.75,238,34.87,0,0,9,0,3.0,0.0,78.0,50,18,609,46,19.03,710,85.77,0,0,56,3,36.0,0.0,40.0,20,9,201,34,18.27,165,121.81,0,0,15,9,17.0,0.0,90.0,149,22,4015,109,31.61,,,1,27,,,63.0,0.0,184.0,136,39,2333,61,24.05,2820,82.73,0,9,,,70.0,0.0,215.0,150,49,1966,67*,19.46,1737,113.18,0,2,150,41,93.0,0.0,5.0,10,1017,573,17,Apr-56,7/102,33.7,3.38,59.8,1,0,0,78.0,75,3823,2916,72,Apr-19,Apr-19,40.5,4.57,53,1,0,0,40.0,39,774,823,37,Mar-16,Mar-16,22.24,6.37,20.9,0,0,0,90.0,,14656,7103,220,Jun-34,,32.28,2.9,66.6,,7,1,184.0,,8782,6455,171,Apr-19,Apr-19,37.74,4.41,51.3,3,0,0,215.0,207,4253,4621,163,Apr-16,Apr-16,28.34,6.51,26,2,0,0

From an early he showed his all-round skills, opening the bowling for his own school, and then switched to left-arm spin on the coach\'s command - because nobody else could turn the ball. He was equally pivotal on the rugby field and tennis court. Boje spent four long years after his initial squad selection quietly desperate to be regarded by the national selectors as a middle-order batsman who bowled usefully, but a spinner he remained. He worked furiously on his bowling as a result, and match-winning analyses in both India and Sri Lanka finally established him as the Test No. 1 in 2000-01, a position he briefly surrendered to Claude Henderson in Australia in 2001-02, and then to Robin Peterson and Paul Adams in 2003. However, he had a big role to play in the final Test of the New Zealand tour of 2003-04, when his eight-wicket haul helped South Africa to a series-levelling win. But after being implicated in the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal in 2000, Boje refused to tour India in subsequent years. After fighting his way back into the squad to face India in 2006, he surprisingly announced his retirement from international cricket to concentrate on his domestic career with the Eagles.

With his wristy leg-side flick and serene cover drive, Amla became the first South African to score a triple century in Test cricket, while also effectively shifting gears to become the fastest batsman to 2,000 (40 innings), 3,000 (57 innings), 4,000 (81 innings) and 5,000 (101 innings) runs in ODI cricket.  \n"", ""Amla's career began at Durban High School, the alma mater of Lance Klusener and Barry Richards, and a world away from his brother, Ahmed. Just four years apart, they grew up on either side of the Apartheid divide, which meant that Ahmed went to a school for the previously disadvantaged, while Amla was afforded better opportunity at a more prestigious institution. "", 'After a successful school career, Amla toured New Zealand with the South African Under-19 team in 2000-01 and captained them at the 2002 Under-19 World Cup. After reeling off four centuries in his first eight innings of the 2004-05 season - in which he was also appointed, and stepped down as, Dolphins captain - he was picked to play for South Africa against India.  ', 'He was not an instant success, with serious questions emerging about his technique and his back lift, in particular, as he mustered 36 runs in four innings against England later that season.', ""When he was handed a second chance, he made it count with 149 against New Zealand at Cape Town, helping South Africa to a draw. He remained a consistent performer, even if not as prolific as South Africa would have liked, and made fifties against Pakistan in 2007. But he saved his best for the following year's tour of India, where he racked up 307 runs in three Tests. That included a majestic 159 in Chennai, his second score of 150 or more. He followed that with a pugnacious 81 in the second innings, in conditions that were trying, thanks to the weather, the pitch and the attack. In the summer of 2008, he got his name on the honours board at Lord's with a sublime century, and, in the process, silenced all whimpers about his pedigree for the longest version."", 'Still, doubts remained over his ability in the shorter formats, but Amla corrected that in 2010. He scored over 1,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket.  It started with a magnum opus tour of India, where the hosts threw everything at him, but could not find a way past his monk-like patience and ability to soak pressure. In the two-Test series, he scored 490 runs and was dismissed just once. In ODIs, he combined quick scoring with stunning consistency, scoring five centuries and four fifties in 15 innings, all the while scoring at over a run a ball, which saw him rise to No.1 in the ODI rankings that year.', ""He was promoted to South Africa's leadership core when he was named vice-captain of the ODI and T20 international teams in June 2011, and later that year, scored centuries in both Tests South Africa played against Australia at home. But Amla's crowning moment came the following year, when he got South Africa's quest to become the No.1-ranked Test team off to an epic start, spending 13 hours and 10 minutes at the Oval crease crafting a triple hundred, and not even needing a change of gloves. Amla also scored a century at Lord's as South Africa took the Test mace from the hosts. "", ""A quickfire 196 against Australia in Perth ensured South Africa stayed on top, and in February 2013, Amla was the ICC's top-ranked Test batsman. He had also decided to keep away from captaincy promotions, and stepped down as the limited-overs vice-captain. "", 'That was why it came as a surprise when, less than 18 months later, Amla accepted the Test captaincy. His tenure was off to a solid start as South Africa beat Sri Lanka 1-0 away from home in his first series in charge, and West Indies at home in his second, in which Amla scored a double hundred in the first match. But that proved a false dawn.', ""Amla had taken over a team in transition and South Africa's struggles came in 2015. They lost a four-Test series in India 3-0 and returned home to lose the opening Test against England. Amla's own form also suffered and he had not crossed fifty in a year. The New Year's Test of 2016 brought a change of fortune as he scored a double hundred, having decided to give up captaincy.

', ""The second time he came within touching distance of four figures in a Test calendar year was in 2013 when he scored 933 runs to ensure South Africa kept the Test mace they won in 2012. By then, de Villiers had also accepted the responsibility of full-time Test gloveman after Mark Boucher's retirement, as well as the ODI and T20 captaincy after Graeme Smith stepped down. He later handed over the T20 reigns to Faf du Plessis. "", ""De Villiers blossomed with the additional responsibility, even as concerns over a chronic back injury grew. He was relieved from keeping in shorter formats to concentrate on captaincy when Quinton de Kock was included in South African squad. By 2014, he had also handed the Test keeper's gloves to de Kock. That seemed a sensible decision because Smith retired in March that year and de Villiers was believed to be the natural successor. However, he was overlooked in favour of Amla."", 'That did nothing to dim de Villiers\' resolve. He came back with even more striking power than before and in January 2015 broke the record for the fastest ODI century, reaching it in just 31 balls against West Indies at the Wanderers. That was the loudest warning cry he could have made for South Africa\'s chances at the 2015 World Cup, but it proved a false one. Despite inspirational leadership from de Villiers, who routinely called his team ""the best"" at the tournament, South Africa bowed out at semi-final stage.', ""  \nThe one stage de Villiers did not set alight was international T20 cricket, where he often found himself batting too low in the line-up and with not enough time to make an impact. He rectified that through the IPL, where he was one of the Royal Challengers Bangalore's most successful players. In a memorable match in the 2014 edition of the competition, de Villiers smacked his countryman Steyn for 23 runs in one over. "", '\nWith de Villiers in high demand from foreign leagues, his workload became a talking point in the 2015-16 summer when he suggested he would have to look at ways to lighten the load. There were rumours of early retirement but those were quashed when he was asked to stand in as Test captain when Amla gave up the job mid-series against England. It was a job de Villiers had always wanted and accepted immediately. He was appointed permanent Test captain in January 2016.\n', ' ']","['ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year - 2010, 2014, 2015']",114.0,191.0,18.0,8765.0,278*,50.66,16077.0,54.51,22.0,46.0,1024.0,64.0,222.0,5.0,228.0,218,39,9577,176,53.5,9473,101.09,25,53,840,204,176.0,5.0,78.0,75,11,1672,79*,26.12,1237,135.16,0,10,140,60,65.0,7.0,141.0,238,23,10689,278*,49.71,19026,56.18,25,60,,,275.0,6.0,263.0,252,44,11123,176,53.47,,,29,63,,,203.0,5.0,275.0,257,51,7405,133*,35.94,4995,148.24,4,48,611,335,188.0,16.0,114.0,5,204,104,2,Feb-49,Feb-49,52,3.05,102,0,0,0,228.0,9,192,202,7,Feb-15,Feb-15,28.85,6.31,27.4,0,0,0,78.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,141.0,,234,138,2,Feb-49,,69,3.53,117,0,0,0,263.0,,192,202,7,Feb-15,Feb-15,28.85,6.31,27.4,0,0,0,275.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

He played 37 Tests for South Africa and was closing in on 400 first-class wickets when he announced he would retire at the end of the 2012/13 season.  \n', ""Harris was brought up in Cape Town and made his first-class debut for Western Province in 1998 but his progress was blocked by Paul Adams and Claude Henderson. He moved to Northerns in October 2002 but it took until 2005, under new coach Richard Pybus, for Harris to establish himself. A haul of 49 wickets in the 2005/06 SuperSport Series, which no bowler bettered, put him in the frame for a call up to the Test side. His overlooking prompted Harris to consider turning his back on South Africa. He played for Warwickshire as a Kolpak player in 2006, taking 31 wickets but after Nicky Boje stormed into retirement from international cricket, disenchanted with his country's treatment of spinners, Harris was back in the frame and eventually made it into the South African squad for the Boxing Day Test against India in 2006."", ""Harris' selection was a departure from the usual South African policy of choosing spinners who can also contribute with the bat and in the field. His debut came in the New Year's Test and he took four first-innings wickets - including one Sachin Tendulkar - and will perhaps be remembered most for his nagging, over-the-wicket line that decidedly put the Indian batsmen in a shell, and helped South Africa wrestle back the initiative. "", ""He showed great promise in 2007, picking up 12 wickets at 20.66 against Pakistan in October, including his first five-wicket haul in the first Test at Karachi. He was named as one of South Africa's Players of the Year for his efforts but struggled to build on his potential in 2008, picking up 24 wickets in the calendar year at a bloated 45.04. Harris found some form in 2009, but a poor showing in the third Test against England in January 2010 - and the subsequent call-up, quickly rescinded, of the ineligible Pakistan-born legspinner, Imran Tahir - meant Harris's place in the team was no longer assured. "", ""Harris went on to tour India - five wickets at 59.40 - West Indies - five at 71.60 - and Dubai - seven at 32.85 against Pakistan - but the return to some kind of form was shortlived and the home series against India would prove Harris' last.

His nickname of Bozie came from ""bulldozer"" because his grandmother observed that he was in the habit of bulldozing around. He has done that to good purpose both for South Africa and, latterly, Glamorgan, where he has gained a reputation as a destructive one-day hitter, the most potent figure by far in their T20 side. \n', 'His 31 ODIs for South Africa came with three centuries (one on debut against Zimbabwe, two against Pakistan) and he played 9 T20s but he lacked consistency at an average of not much above 30 meant that by the end of 2013 he had fallen out of favour. He also bowled six balls in his ODI career and conceded 17 in one over against Pakistan. ""Misbah-ul-Haq was on strike and I tossed one of my leggies up and he clubbed it for six,"" he said later. ""I turned round and said, \'Let\'s see if you can do it again\' - and he did.""', 'He signed a Kolpak deal with Glamorgan for the 2015 season, combining that with captaincy of the Eastern Cape-based Warriors. Justification was not hard to find: here was a player with 31 ODIs and nine T20Is spaced out between 2010 and 2013, who batted in every position across the top seven. ""I definitely feel I held my own at international level and put in performances,"" he said. ""Unfortunately I ran into a few really good bowlers when I ended up opening, which wasn\'t my preferred position. It was an unsettling period because I did move around, I was in and out of the side and I didn\'t feel backed.""', 'The move to Glamorgan was cathartic.  His menace was obvious in all competitions in 2015, but his 2016 season was inhibited by a knee injury, suffered at the start of the season, which restricted him to white-ball cricket. He had surgery in South Africa at the end of the season, insisting that his appetite for red-ball cricket remained, only to become a limited-overs specialist a year later.', ""His limited-overs cricket, though, was formidable. He scored 502 runs in the 2016 T20 Blast season, hitting 29 sixes to share the record with Chris Gayle, and also topped Glamorgan's One-Day Cup averages with 367 runs at 61.1. His legspin was another useful weapon: he took a career-best 3 for 20 against Somerset to get Glamorgan into the last eight of the NatWest Blast, but an improvement on that figure as he took 4 for 32 in the quarter-final against Yorkshire in Cardiff could not prevent Glamorgan's elimination."", ""He stood out, too, in 2017. With three hundreds and two fifties, he made the most runs in this year's Royal London Cup - 564 - and followed up with two T20 hundreds as Glamorgan reached NatWest Blast Finals Day. His IPL experience had amounted to only three games for Delhi Daredevils in 2011, but as he became a limited-overs specialist, at 32, his form was eye-catching enough to deserve interest among T20 leagues worldwide.\n"", '\n']",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31.0,29,3,843,124,32.42,1024,82.32,3,3,82,10,12.0,0.0,9.0,9,1,210,78,26.25,162,129.62,0,1,23,7,2.0,0.0,111.0,195,17,6641,190,37.3,,,14,30,,,75.0,0.0,186.0,178,18,7584,142,47.4,8414,90.13,18,48,,,65.0,0.0,226.0,221,32,5863,127*,31.02,4172,140.53,4,36,514,276,77.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31.0,1,6,17,0,-,-,-,17,-,0,0,0,9.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,111.0,,3516,2132,50,Apr-16,May-50,42.64,3.63,70.3,3,0,0,186.0,,1482,1345,40,Apr-39,Apr-39,33.62,5.44,37,1,0,0,226.0,67,931,1221,38,Apr-32,Apr-32,32.13,7.86,24.5,1,0,0

A feisty character with a celebration longer than most fast-bowlers' run-ups and a range of variations, Tahir made the googly his biggest weapon in the limited-overs formats. \n"", 'That was not always what Tahir was being primed for. When he arrived in South Africa, after meeting his wife Sumayya during the 1998 Under-19 World Cup, he established himself in the first-class set-up.

Less than a week after he was naturalised, he was picked in South Africa's squad for the one-dayers against India. But he had to wait until the 2011 World Cup for his debut and he made an immediate impact. He finished the tournament as South Africa's second-highest wicket-taker. "", ""That summer, Tahir made his Test debut against Australia in Cape Town, in the same match as Vernon Philander. Despite all the hype around how he would complete South Africa's attack, Tahir struggled for the same success he had at the domestic level in a pace-heavy pack and on pitches unsuitable for his style of bowling. In his 11th Test, against Australia in Adelaide in November 2012, it seemed the experiment was over. Tahir's figures were 0 for 260, the most expensive returns without a wicket in Test history, and he was dropped."", ""He remained out of contention in all formats until South Africa's tour to the UAE in October 2013, where he would play against his former countrymen. Tahir took his first Test five-for in Dubai but it did not earn him a more permanent place. Instead, he carved a niche for himself in the shorter formats, where he showed much more control with his craft. "", ""Tahir earned a reputation for being able to contain the middle-periods of matches while also taking wickets, and his rise coincided with South Africa's limited-overs recovery, especially after the 2015 World Cup.

He spent a couple of years bowling just\ntwo lengths before a serious ankle injury in 1998 forced him to drop his\npace and develop further skills. He was a revelation in his debut Test, ending with match-winning figures of 8 for 64 against India in Calcutta. He showed glimpses of his big-hitting in the years leading to the 1999 World Cup.

Jacques Kallis is the broad-shouldered colossus of the South African team, a figure whose looming presence inspires calm in some and dread in others.\n \nFew players who belong to the modern age are a better fit for the notion of the classical cricketer. Kallis is a fine, forceful batsman who has at his disposal both a rock-solid technique and a mind impervious to distraction. Though his role as a bowler diminishes with each passing season, he will be remembered as a purveyor of sometimes surprising pace and swing, and awkward bounce. In the slips, his sure-handedness and rattlesnake reflexes make ridiculous catches look regulation. \n', 'Kallis announced himself as a batsman of international stature in his seventh Test, the drawn Boxing Day epic at Melbourne in 1997, when he scored a fighting 101 on a worn last-day pitch. Not even Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne could dislodge him before he had all but saved the match for South Africa.', 'Over the years Kallis has delivered many such innings, performances in which grit is a far more valuable commodity than glitz to a South African team that remains more confident in the field and with its fast bowlers in full cry than as a batting unit. Kallis has willingly shouldered the role of the fulcrum around which the wheel must try to turn. But, occasionally, he has unfurled a stroke of startling aggression that hints at what might have been.', 'Certainly, his lofted drive, which begins with a menacing backlift before uncoiling into the irresistible momentum of a mighty downward swoop of the bat and finishing in a twirl of Baroque, might be described as Mozart in motion. In the lightning flash of that fleeting instant it really does seem as if Kallis could, in the words of one observer, hit a six whenever he felt like it.', ""His critics, particularly those who have a limited understanding of the dynamics of the South African team, accuse him of not dominating attacks he has already ground into the dust, of unnecessarily slow scoring, and of failing to take the match situation into account as he plots his innings. All of which hints at selfishness, which is quite ironical, because his team-mates vouch for the fact that Kallis bats the way he does precisely because he puts his team first and his personal ambitions some way behind. It's the only way he knows how."", ' ']","['ICC Test Player of the Year 2005', 'ICC Player of the Year 2005']",166.0,280.0,40.0,13289.0,224,55.37,28903.0,45.97,45.0,58.0,1488.0,97.0,200.0,0.0,328.0,314,53,11579,139,44.36,15885,72.89,17,86,911,137,131.0,0.0,25.0,23,4,666,73,35.05,558,119.35,0,5,56,20,7.0,0.0,257.0,421,57,19695,224,54.1,,,62,97,,,264,0,424.0,406,65,14845,155*,43.53,,,23,109,,,162.0,0.0,176.0,171,28,4416,97*,30.88,3927,112.45,0,32,437,100,54.0,0.0,166.0,272,20232,9535,292,Jun-54,Sep-92,32.65,2.82,69.2,7,5,0,328.0,283,10750,8680,273,May-30,May-30,31.79,4.84,39.3,2,2,0,25.0,19,276,333,12,Apr-15,Apr-15,27.75,7.23,23,1,0,0,257.0,,29033,13532,427,Jun-54,,31.69,2.79,67.9,,8,0,424.0,,13673,10772,351,May-30,May-30,30.68,4.72,38.9,3,3,0,176.0,150,2747,3482,114,Apr-15,Apr-15,30.54,7.6,24,2,0,0

By the time of his selection on the 1994 tour of England he was considered one of the most promising prospects, even though he didn't play in any of the Tests and had a poor tour. In 1995-96 he made headlines with his first double-hundred, but his form fluctuated and he had to wait until 1997-98 before making his Test debut. He did enough to be picked for his second tour of England in 1998 but struggled in the four Tests he played, scoring 59 runs in six innings.

Langeveldt first came to prominence with his ability to swing the ball at genuine pace, and further work on his action in recent seasons allowed him to generate even more movement, bringing him to the attention of the national selectors. He made his one-day international debut against Kenya in Kimberley in 2001-02, taking two top-order wickets. He followed that with career-best figures of 4 for 21 when the two sides met for a second time at Newlands shortly afterwards. Langeveldt was included in South Africa's 15-man squad for their ill-starred World Cup campaign in 2003, playing only in the pool match against Kenya. He returned to favour when South Africa experienced a dramatic slump in the middle of 2004, taking 3 for 31 in Sri Lanka and then, in perhaps his most impressive spell so far, 3 for 17 against Bangladesh in the ICC Champions Trophy.  \n"", ""He returned in style again against England at Newlands in 2004-05, breaking his hand batting on his return but taking 5 for 46. It was enough to win him selection for the series in the Caribbean which followed. It was in this series that Langeveldt came into his own. In the third one-day match in Barbados, he produced one of the most sensational finales in one-day international history,  plucking a hat-trick out of thin air to steal a one-run victory over West Indies and giving his team a series victory. After a disappointing tour of India and Australia, Langeveldt did not play against Australia at home. He was recalled for the Champions Trophy, however, after some impressive domestic performances. Looked well below par in back-to-back ODI series appearances against India and Pakistan at home, but was included in South Africa's 15-man squad for the World Cup. With memories of his previous success in West Indies, Langeveldt enjoyed a successful tournament with his brand of late reverse swing being particularly effective. He finished as the team's joint leading wicket-taker but will continue to face stiff competition from the array of pace bowling options around him. In March 2008 Langeveldt, absent from the Test side since early 2006, opted out of a three-Test series in India, upset by the controversy surrounding his selection for the tour to India. His inclusion ahead of Andre Nel was seen by many as pandering to Cricket South Africa's transformation policy. In April 2008, he signed a two-year contract with Derbyshire as a Kolpak player and the doubts over his international future increased after this decision. The following year, the Kolkata Knight Riders came calling with an IPL contract but, rather strangely, he was benched till their final match where he performed creditably.

Dad Peter led the South African attack through the 1960s; uncle Graeme was one of the finest, if not the finest, left-hander to play the game. Shaun has bits of both in his makeup, but it is as an immaculate, Hadlee-esque, line and length seamer that he has established himself. At the start of his first-class career, though, he was both slippery and aggressive and his Natal team-mates delighted in totting up the number of batsmen he pinned match after match. He was brought into the South African Test side against Michael Atherton's England tourists in 1995/96 and although his father was the convener of selectors, there was never a hint of nepotism and the younger Pollock took quickly to the higher level.  \n"", ""In 1996 he had a spell with Warwickshire cut short because of an ankle injury and missed the tour to India at the end of that year. But he soon returned to resume his new-ball partnership with Allan Donald and this pairing was the springboard of much of South Africa's success during the latter half of the 1990s. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the emergence of Pollock inspired Donald to greater heights as the latter found himself with a partner who both complemented and challenged him. Perhaps the straightest bowler in world cricket, Pollock is able to move the ball both ways at a lively pace. He also possesses stamina and courage in abundance as in proved in Adelaide in 1998 when he toiled on hour after hour in blazing heat to take 7 for 87 in 41 overs on a perfect batting pitch. "", ""If there is a criticism of Pollock, it is that he has underperformed with the bat, but most Test teams would be perfectly happy to have him in their side if he never scored a run. Pollock was thrust into the captaincy in April 2000 when Hansie Cronje was drummed out of the game, and he faced the biggest challenge of his career - to lift a shocked and demoralised South African side. However, after a solid start to his captaincy, he lost some credibility after a 3-0 drubbing in Australia in 2001-02, and was later blamed for South Africa's disastrous World Cup in which they failed to qualify for the Super Sixes. As a result, Pollock immediately lost the captaincy and was replaced by Graeme Smith. \nThough his nagging brilliance around offstump remains, his pace and ability to take wickets at the top of the order has dipped. "", ""Pollock missed the first Test against Australia at home in early 2006 with a back injury and was relegated from opener to first-change by the third. Four wickets in two Tests, with a new run-up and on pitches tailormade for his style, showed that he has slowed. But with 100 Tests under his belt, Pollock remains an integral part of the side. He missed the first Test against Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second daughter, returned for the second and was a pale shade of his former self. He managed just one wicket, and it was a telling sign of what appeared to be Pollock's decline to see him resort to offspin after being tonked over his head for six by Sanath Jayasuriya. All that was reversed in the Champions Trophy in India, where he showed great form, and against India and Pakistan at home at the end of 2006 and in the new year. Man of the Series in both the ODIs and Tests against India, Pollock was highly impressive with the new ball and chipped in with useful scores down the order. It was fitting that he became the first South African to take 400 Test wickets. Pollock continued his fine form against the touring Pakistanis next, despite being surprisingly rested for the final Test. Thrifty with the ball and useful with bat he offered precious control and breathing space for his captain. In the ODI series, he was the highest wicket-taker on either side and his 5 for 23 in the final game crushed a weary Pakistan. For the second consecutive one-day series in a row, Pollock was adjudged Man of the Series. It was decent form to carry into his fourth World Cup, but his lack of pace was exposed on the small Caribbean grounds, especially by Matthew Hayden, although his miserly spell against England was key in South Africa securing a semi-final berth.

Philander hails from a country famous for producing high-quality fast bowlers, and he has done everything in his first few games to keep up that tradition. His strength isn't extreme pace, but he has everything else going for him: the ability to move the ball both ways at a sharp speed, and relentlessly attack the stumps over long spells.  \n"", ""His promotion to the Test squad was the result of consistent performances in the domestic circuit - he got a chance to play the home series against Australia in 2011 after taking 35 wickets at an average of 16.11 in the 2010-11 domestic season - but even he wouldn't have anticipated the immediate impact he made. He started with a Man-of-the-Match performance in his first Test, taking 8 for 78, including a second-innings haul of 5 for 15, to help South Africa to a stunning win in Cape Town. He followed it up with another five-for in the second Test, winning him the Man-of-the-Series prize. The good times continued in his next two series as well, as he grabbed 16 in two Tests against Sri Lanka and then tormented New Zealand in the three Test away series. He thus had six five-fors in his first seven Tests, and reached 50 wickets only 139 days from his debut. "", ""Before all that Test success, Philander performed consistently for Cape Cobras. He also played for South Africa Under-19s on their tour of England in 2003 and the U-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. In 2006-07 he produced an impressive one-day season for the Cobras, averaging 72 with the bat and 30 with the ball. It was enough to earn him a place in South Africa's squad for their one-day tour of Ireland, a team he'd been lined up to play for before a stress fracture of his back, and he was rewarded for a good display there with a spot in the Twenty20 World Championships in 2007. \n"", ' ', ' \n']",[],58.0,82.0,18.0,1538.0,74,24.03,3338.0,46.07,0.0,8.0,174.0,15.0,17.0,0.0,30.0,19,7,151,30*,12.58,213,70.89,0,0,14,0,6.0,0.0,7.0,4,0,14,6,3.5,28,50,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,161.0,221,43,4679,168,26.28,9828,47.6,3,17,,,41,0,128.0,88,29,1382,79*,23.42,1827,75.64,0,5,,,12.0,0.0,108.0,75,37,971,56*,25.55,721,134.67,0,1,53,41,22.0,0.0,58.0,109,10420,4632,214,Jun-21,10/102,21.64,2.66,48.6,7,13,2,30.0,28,1279,986,41,04-Dec,04-Dec,24.04,4.62,31.1,2,0,0,7.0,6,83,114,4,Feb-23,Feb-23,28.5,8.24,20.7,0,0,0,161.0,,27981,12242,569,Jul-61,,21.51,2.62,49.1,31,24,2,128.0,,5365,4172,127,04-Dec,04-Dec,32.85,4.66,42.2,3,0,0,108.0,100,1903,2522,81,May-17,May-17,31.13,7.95,23.4,1,1,0

Peterson, a left-arm finger spinner from Eastern Province, fills all three vacancies more than competently. At first glance he seems an overly orthodox slow bowler, but he turns the ball appreciably given help from the pitch and is invariably a tidy operator with a steadily developing understanding of flight. Peterson has also cultivated an unusual delivery that turns into the right-handed batsmen.He was part of the South African Under-19 team that took on Pakistan and England, and he played the Under-19 World Cup in 1998. Peterson made his Test debut in 2003 against Bangladesh, taking five wickets and scored 61. It was in Bangladesh where he took his first five-wicket haul as well, on the 2008 tour. \n', ""Given more chances in ODIs, Peterson eventually began to grab his opportunities and his bowling, in particular, developed very usefully. He was part of South Africa's squad at the 2007 World Cup and hit the winning boundary - an outside edge past slip - in South Africa's one-wicket victory over Sri Lanka at Providence. He slipped out of national contention for a time, and didn't play for South Africa again for two years, but in the meantime represented the Warriors with distinction. In April 2009 he moved to Cape Town and, despite having a year remaining on his Warriors contract, requested a transfer to the Cape Cobras because his partner wanted to pursue her career in the Western Cape. "", ""Peterson feared that he was simply treading water, however, and came close to relinquishing his dreams of further honours with South Africa. He made himself unavailable for national selection and headed to Derbyshire as a Kolpak player. Nevertheless, he was named in South Africa's squad for the 2011 World Cup, and though his inclusion was initally greeted by scepticism in some quarters, Peterson proved the doubters wrong with some superb all-round performances. He finished as South Africa's leading wicket-taker in the tournament, and particular highlights included his match-winning innings in the thrilling victory over India and his three-wicket opening burst against England.

', 'After a successful county stint with Kent, Parnell made his Test debut against England in the fourth match at the Wanderers in January 2010. He played three Tests that year and earned a lucrative IPL contract when Delhi Daredevils splashed out US$ 610,000 on him. ', 'A groin injury, however, ruled him out of the tournament. It would impact the next summer as Parnell was unable to tour Sri Lanka in August with the South Africa A side. But he recovered in time for the ODI series against Zimbabwe at home. Parnell played just one match in the 2011 World Cup and was also part of the 2012 World T20. He was not considered for the Champions Trophy the following year.

Parnell announced his return with a wicket off his first ball and added another two deliveries later. He, however, bowled just eight more overs before leaving the field with another groin injury. "", ""He recovered for the World T20 a month later and played in ODIs in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Parnell played just one match in South Africa's 2015 World Cup campaign, and didn't make it to their World T20 squad a year later."", ""Parnell, though, dominated the domestic scene in the 2015-16 season. Despite a foot niggle, he was the third-highest wicket-taker in the one-day cup and Cobras' most successful bowler, despite playing nine of their 11 games. In the same season, Parnell opened the batting on several occasions in the Ram Slam T20 Challenge with a fair amount of success.

Extreme pace, the ability to swing the ball both ways, and accuracy have perhaps made him the country's best ever. At the peak of his powers, Steyn possessed a lithe and wiry body, a steaming run-up that culminated in a aerodynamic action, and a ripper of an outswinger. \n"", ""Steyn grew up in Phalaborwa, in the country's northern-most province, and spent his childhood obsessed with skateboarding. It was only when he moved to a bigger city, Pretoria, that he gave cricket a proper go and it did not take long before he was considered a serious prospect. He played just seven first-class matches before he was selected for South Africa and made his debut against England in 2004, in the same match as AB de Villiers. "", 'He did not have an immediate impact and spent the following winter playing for Essex in Division 2 of the county championship, and the 2005-06 season honing his craft in the domestic set-up before he was recalled, a visibly fiercer bowler. Steyn took 16 wickets in his second series, against New Zealand, but it was only when he faced them the next year, in the 2007-08 summer, that he announced himself as one of the fierce fast men. ', 'A visibly fired-up Steyn took ten wickets in the first Test in Johannesburg. Then, shortly after lunch on the first day of the second Test in Centurion, he delivered a short ball to Craig Cumming, who missed. The ball crashed into his face and sent him to intensive care. ', 'The flow of wickets became a gush, and in 2008, he became the fastest South African at the time, and the 15th fastest overall, to reach 100 Test wickets. That September, Steyn was named ICC Test Player of the Year after taking 86 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 18.10. ', 'He was part of the South African side that beat England and Australia for the first time away from home since readmission, and then proved he could do it on the subcontinent. In 2010, Steyn summoned reverse-swing reminiscent of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and took 7 for 51 as South Africa beat India in Nagpur. ', 'He went on to win the Test championship with the team in England in 2012 and took his 300th Test wicket the following year, against New Zealand. He was only the fourth South African to rack up that many scalps. ', ""After he turned 30, Steyn's injury-free run ended. He suffered a groin strain in the Champions Trophy in June 2013, a side strain later that year and a rib fracture in early 2014, a year in which he had three hamstrings strains but also played a part in South Africa's first Test series win in Sri Lanka in over two decades."", ""He led South Africa's attack at the 2015 World Cup but also became the face of their failed campaign. He delivered the final over in the semi-final against New Zealand and was hit for six by Grant Elliott off the penultimate ball."", ""Steyn did not seem to be the same afterwards. In November 2015, he suffered a groin strain during the first Test against India in Mohali and missed the rest of the four-match series. He returned in December to play against England but a shoulder injury cut short that summer. In the 2015-16 season, Steyn missed six of South Africa's eight Tests and all their ODIs.

In 2009-10, he went one better and was the leading run-scorer in the first-class competition with 1189 runs at an average of 66.05. In the next season, he was the second-highest run-getter in the one-day cup. \n \nHe was rewarded with a place in the South Africa A squad which toured Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in 2010. Rossouw averaged over 40 in first-class cricket in three of the four seasons which followed - 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 - and despite regular appearances in A sides, he was still unable to break into to the Test team. ', 'One particular tweet did not help. Like many South Africans, Rossouw, then 21, took the team\'s quarter-final defeat to New Zealand at the World Cup hard. His post included the word ""chokers"" and, although it was soon deleted, the memory stuck.\n \nIt was in the shorter formats where he had more opportunities. In 2014, Rossouw picked up an IPL contract with Royal Challengers Bangalore, although playing opportunities were limited in a star-studded squad. Eventually, in August that year, he was included in a South Africa\'s ODI squad. ', 'He toured Zimbabwe for a visit that also included a tri-series against Australia. He had a nightmarish start to international cricket and racked up four ducks in his first six innings. The South African selectors, though, had seen evidence of his quality over seasons in the domestic game and persisted with him. He was also included in the T20 squad for the Australia tour in November 2014, where he scored 78 in his first match in Adelaide. ', ""In January 2015, Rossouw scored his first international century, against West Indies in Johannesburg, in a match in which several records were broken including the fastest ODI century at the time, scored by AB de Villiers. Rossouw had done enough to be included in the 2015 World Cup squad where he played in six matches, including the quarter-final and semi-final.

But there is a diverse array of opinions when it comes to just when the black Free Stater will be properly ready for the step up. Tshabalala had his first national call-up in February 2006 when he was named in the squad for the Twenty20 international against Australia.

His early century drought might suggest otherwise, but he is a man for long innings, a man who seems to love to bat on and on. His first century arrived in Bangladesh, in his tenth Test, and he made it a big one, falling five short of a double. He scored two more in the series in India immediately after. After 12 Tests his run aggregate and average were identical to that of Lara's after 12.

Unfortunately for West Indies, they haven't been able to utilise his services as often as they probably would have liked to: till the end of 2013, more than nine years since his Test debut, he had played only 40 out of West Indies' 81 Tests in the same period. Prioritising IPL over international cricket has led to differences with the board, while injuries have also limited his Test appearances, but as a limited-overs player Bravo remains a key member for West Indies and took over from Darren Sammy as ODI captain in 2013. He held the post till December 2014, when the selectors replaced him with Jason Holder and left him out of the ODI side, two months after he had played a central role in the team pulling out mid-way from a tour to India due to issues with the payment structure in their revised contracts.  \n"", ""As a player, Bravo's skills and self-confidence at the big stage were never in doubt right from the early days in his international career. He made his Test debut at Lord's in July 2004, and took three wickets in the first innings with his medium-paced swingers. He also showed a cool enough temperament to forge a confident start at the crease with the bat. By the end of the series, it was clear that Bravo was a special talent. He scored plenty of runs and claimed a bunch of wickets in four Tests, but nowhere was his ability more evident than in Manchester, where he top-scored for the team, and then restricted England with a six-wicket haul. He hit 107 against South Africa in April 2004-05 at Antigua to bring up his maiden century and in November 2005, scored a magnificent 113 against Australia at Hobart. He dazzled in the ODI series against India in May 2006, bamboozling the batsmen with his slower ones and chipping in with match-winning contributions with the bat. He grew as a player in the limited-overs format in the 2006-07 season with a fluent unbeaten 112, his maiden ODI ton, against England in the Champions Trophy and achieved his best career figures, 4 for 39, against India in the last game before the World Cup. He was often a rare glimmer of joy among some depressing moments until an ankle injury struck in 2008 and ruled him out for eight months. "", ""Around that time, his value as a Twenty20 player came into focus, and with several such leagues coming - most prominently the IPL - Bravo chose those commitments over the West Indians ones. In 2010, he, along with Kieron Pollard, turned down a WICB central contract which would require him to be available to play for West Indies at all times. Next year, he chose the IPL over a two-Test home series against Pakistan. Between 2011 and 2013, West Indies played 24 Tests but Bravo didn't play any of them. He retired from Test cricket in January 2015."", 'On the other hand, he became a fixture in the Chennai Super Kings line-up in the IPLs: in the 2013 season, he led the wickets tally with 32. He came back to play for West Indies in the limited-overs games, but the feeling persisted that West Indies were severely under-utilising his talents.', '\n']",[],40.0,71,1,2200,113,31.42,4527,48.59,3,13,269,21,41.0,0.0,164.0,141,24,2968,112*,25.36,3606,82.3,2,10,240,58,73.0,0.0,66.0,59,12,1142,66*,24.29,981,116.41,0,4,67,49,35.0,0.0,100.0,180,7,5302,197,30.64,,,8,30,,,89.0,0.0,227.0,198,30,4046,112*,24.08,,,2,13,,,105.0,0.0,439.0,357,99,6218,70*,24.1,4900,126.89,0,20,404,297,216.0,0.0,40.0,61,6466,3426,86,Jun-55,Jun-84,39.83,3.17,75.1,6,2,0,164.0,150,6511,5874,199,Jun-43,Jun-43,29.51,5.41,32.7,6,1,0,66.0,56,1042,1470,52,Apr-28,Apr-28,28.26,8.46,20,2,0,0,100.0,,11025,5918,177,06-Nov,,33.43,3.22,62.2,9,7,0,227.0,,8609,7494,271,Jun-43,Jun-43,27.65,5.22,31.7,8,2,0,439.0,420,8514,11731,480,May-23,May-23,24.43,8.26,17.7,9,2,0

Built like a fast bowler, and with the fiery attitude of one, Benn is also no stranger to on-field controversies. In 2007, he was involved in an ugly incident with batsman Robin Parris during a club game at Queen\'s Park Oval, and in 2009 was involved in a heated on-field argument with Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson in the third Test at Perth. There were yet more charges to be added to his sheet, as Benn was dismissed from the field by his own captain during South Africa\'s one-day whitewashing of West Indies in 2010  after apparently refusing to bowl over the wicket, and in the Test series which followed was involved in several colourful exchanges with Dale Steyn.  \n', ""But between the controversies came consistent performances which made clear his passion, determination and skill as a bowler and Benn has also cemented a spot as West Indies' most reliable spinner in years. His height gives him a curious aspect akin to a windmill when he delivers, but it also makes facing him on a dry track a daunting prospect. He has been economical without being spectacular for West Indies in one-day cricket, but registered remarkable figures of 4 for 6 in a Twenty20 against Zimbabwe in early 2010 - a match that, however, West Indies went on to lose. He picked up eight wickets in the first Test against England at Sabina Park in February 2009 to help set up what was ultimately a Test series win - although his efforts were forgotten amid Jerome Taylor's destruction of England's top order. His first five-wicket haul came in the drawn Test against Australia at Adelaide in December 2009, and he picked up career-best figures of 6 for 81 in the Third Test against South Africa in June 2010.\n"", ' June 2010']",[],26.0,39,5,486,42,14.29,802,60.59,0,0,58,13,14.0,0.0,47.0,30,7,182,31,7.91,240,75.83,0,0,19,3,9.0,0.0,24.0,7,4,37,13*,12.33,42,88.09,0,0,5,1,10.0,0.0,99.0,142,21,2059,79,17.01,,,0,7,,,79.0,0.0,130.0,75,26,599,39,12.22,,,0,0,,,53.0,0.0,96.0,30,12,178,21,9.88,188,94.68,0,0,11,11,30.0,0.0,26.0,42,7321,3402,87,Jun-81,8/108,39.1,2.78,84.1,2,6,0,47.0,46,2387,1913,39,Apr-18,Apr-18,49.05,4.8,61.2,3,0,0,24.0,24,504,606,18,04-Jun,04-Jun,33.66,7.21,28,1,0,0,99.0,,22603,10134,379,Jun-43,,26.73,2.69,59.6,,19,0,130.0,,6322,4312,150,May-18,May-18,28.74,4.09,42.1,8,1,0,96.0,94,1950,2137,88,04-Jun,04-Jun,24.28,6.57,22.1,1,0,0

When he played his first Test eight years later, Barath showed he was well worth the hype, with a scintillating 104 at the Gabba, a performance which stood out for its poise and crisp strokeplay even as much bigger names failed miserably. The knock only justified all the excitement that Barath had drawn from his early days.  Considered to be one of the most promising young batting talents in the Caribbean, Barath was playing in the Trinidad Under-13 team in 2001 and led the side in 2002. He broke into the U-15 side at 13 and played for three seasons. Barath made his first-class debut for Trinidad in January 2007, scoring 73 against Guyana and two centuries in successive matches against Leewards and Windwards Islands soon followed. He was part of the West Indies U-19 team for the 2008 World Cup and consistent success at domestic level earned him a spot in the West Indies A team against the touring England side in January 2009. He made it count, scoring a hundred against an attack which included James Anderson, Stephen Harmison and Ryan Sidebottom. Many considered Barath unlucky to miss out on the tour of England that followed but his first call-up to the Test squad came soon after, against Bangladesh at home.

With a high, elegant action and good control of flight, Banks possessed sufficient guile to trouble the best, but it was his resourceful lower-middle-order batting that really caught the eye - the following week in Antigua, he contributed an assured and vital 47 not out, as West Indies successfully chased 418 for victory, the highest fourth-innings target in Test history.

His sprint to the crease is reminiscent of Malcolm Marshall's, but, unlike Marshall, his open-chested deliveries seem to limit his ability to move the ball away from the right-hander. His misfortune has been the plague of modern fast bowlers: stress fractures. Yet he is a determined man, who recovered from back injuries when critics had written him off at the end of West Indies' tour of England in 2000, and thus fulfilled his promise to be back in the game. He took four wickets on his return to the one-day side in Zimbabwe in 2001, as West Indies beat India in the final of the Coca-Cola Cup, and after a moderately successful World Cup in 2003, he was recalled to the Test team for the home series against Sri Lanka. He responded with five wickets in the drawn first Test, and a second-innings haul of 7 for 57 in the second, as West Indies sealed a seven-wicket victory.  \n"", 'From there on, he was shunted in and out of the squad, before being included half-way through the Test series for his experience. He shared the new ball with younger speed merchants, and though he put the ball in the right place, his inability to put fear in the hearts of batsmen meant that he was expensive and ineffective on the tour to England. Against India at home in 2006, however, Collymore pegged away all through the series, providing a valuable tourniquet at one end. He was way ahead of the other fast bowlers in terms of his economy-rate (2.33) and always appeared capable of taking a wicket. His spell on the first morning at Antigua floored India and, despite not looking fully fit, maintained his accuracy throughout. He played only eight international games in the 2006-07 season and averaged over 30 but just ahead of the selection for World Cup he rocked Jamaica with a six-for in the Carib series. He failed to carry that form into the tournament itself but still found himself briefly in the top 10 of the ICC Test rankings. In 2008, he replaced Ryan Harris at Sussex, joining the club as a Kolpak and he performed with distinction on the south coast before moving to Middlesex at the end of the 2010 season. \n']",[],30.0,52,27,197,16*,7.88,642,30.68,0,0,19,0,6.0,0.0,84.0,35,17,104,13*,5.77,261,39.84,0,0,5,2,12.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,167.0,223,103,913,23,7.6,,,0,0,,,49.0,0.0,143.0,55,29,156,13*,6,,,0,0,,,22.0,0.0,6.0,2,1,5,4,5,11,45.45,0,0,0,0,4.0,0.0,30.0,53,6337,3004,93,Jul-57,11/134,32.3,2.84,68.1,3,4,1,84.0,80,4074,2924,83,May-51,May-51,35.22,4.3,49,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,167.0,,28315,13214,492,Jul-57,,26.85,2.8,57.5,,12,2,143.0,,6564,4744,149,May-27,May-27,31.83,4.33,44,1,2,0,6.0,5,95,133,3,Jan-21,Jan-21,44.33,8.4,31.6,0,0,0

Collins was a keen footballer before he fell into cricket, and his left-arm bowling follows the lineage of Bernard Julien and Garry Sobers, and he finds enough swing into the right-hander to cause the best batsmen difficulty. In November 1998 he took three wickets in 11 balls for West Indies A against India, a spell which led to his Test debut against Australia the following March. For a long time after that, he was best remembered for an injury of the cruellest kind, when a Jason Gillespie delivery trapped a testicle outside his box. He worked on his fitness, though, and he returned to the side in 2001-02, with a higher arm action and an extra yard of pace. He took just nine wickets in West Indies' series victory over India, but claimed the prize scalp of Sachin Tendulkar on three occasions. He struggled on India's flat pitches, though, before terrorising Bangladesh in 2002-03. What followed was a less-than-enchanting outing against Australia, and Collins didn't play for close to a year. But he returned to take on England in March 2004, and within six balls, removed Michael Vaughan, before taking three more wickets, to herald a successful return to the side. After a spell out of the side which saw him miss the World Cup and the 2007 tour of England, he was recalled to the West Indies squad for the Twenty20 World Championship and soon after he signed a two-year deal with Surrey as a Kolpak player. His international career was further thrown into doubt when he pulled out of the subsequent series against Sri Lanka in order to fulfil his county contract. \n"", ' March 2008 \n']",['First-class debut: 1997 v Guyana at Bridgetown'],32.0,47,7,235,24,5.87,701,33.52,0,0,30,0,7.0,0.0,30.0,12,5,30,10*,4.28,50,60,0,0,1,0,8.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,148.0,188,54,871,25,6.5,,,0,0,,,31.0,0.0,98.0,39,12,166,55*,6.14,,,0,1,,,17.0,0.0,29.0,5,3,3,1*,1.5,8,37.5,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,32.0,61,6964,3671,106,Jun-53,9/117,34.63,3.16,65.6,7,3,0,30.0,30,1577,1212,39,May-43,May-43,31.07,4.61,40.4,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,148.0,,25317,13033,501,Jun-24,,26.01,3.08,50.5,,13,0,98.0,,4717,3444,149,07-Nov,07-Nov,23.11,4.38,31.6,3,2,0,29.0,29,598,777,26,Mar-13,Mar-13,29.88,7.79,23,0,0,0

He never seemed to play in the V, or off the front foot, but used soft hands, canny deflections, and a whiplash pull-shot to maintain a Test average of over 50. While the cricket world was obsessed with Brian Lara's unquestionable talent, Chanderpaul showed that there were alternate ways to be consistent and prolific in Test cricket over a long period of time, becoming only the second West Indian to score 10,000 Test runs. \n"", 'When Chanderpaul started out, he had a couple of problems: first, a low conversion rate of around one hundred to every ten fifties, and secondly, his physical frailty, widely thought to be hypochondria. That myth was exploded when a large piece of floating bone was removed from his foot late in 2000, and, suitably liberated, he set about rectifying his hundreds problem, scoring three in four Tests against India in 2001-02, and two more in the home series against Australia the following year, including 104 as West Indies successfully chased a world-record 418 for victory in the final Test in Antigua. ', ""Since then, he managed to keep his own standards at a remarkably high level despite the perennial problems that West Indies faced.

"", 'A stint as West Indies captain followed in 2005-06, and though he celebrated with a double-century in front of his home fans in Guyana, it was clear that captaincy was affecting his batting, and in 2006 he gave it up to concentrate on his main job. ', ""Perhaps his greatest contribution, though, had been in holding together West Indies' fragile batting line-up after Lara's retirement. With a couple of other senior batsmen, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chris Gayle, not being available due to various reasons, Chanderpaul's contributions were immense, as he has defied bowling attacks in all countries and all conditions, often with minimal support from the other end. One of the best examples of that was against Australia in 2012, in the series in which he got to 10,000 Test runs: he ran up scores of 103*, 12, 94, 68 and 69, for an aggregate of 346 in five innings.

Dottin was among only two women, apart from Stafanie Taylor, to receive a Grade A contract. She has, however, been vocally critical of the continued pay disparity between men's and women's cricket."", ""She was largely responsible for West Indies' victory in the T20 tri-nation tournament - also involving England and New Zealand Women - in November 2013, slapping 46 unbeaten runs off 35 balls in the final and being named Player of the Series. More recently, she has proved her worth as a handy pace bowler, taking 4 for 12 against England in the 2014 Women's World Twenty20, which helped West Indies win the group match by nine runs. She was also a crucial part of West Indies' victory in the following edition of the tournament. Dottin took nine wickets at 13.55, including 2 for 33 in the final, as West Indies became the only team outside of England, Australia and New Zealand to win a global tournament.

But Dillon has neither the deceptive pace of the young Walsh nor the matchless craft of the later model. He remains an adequate stock bowler who, in another era, would hardly qualify for the new ball. Nevertheless, he did everything that was asked of him during West Indies' series victory over India in 2001-02, leading the attack with a rarely-witnessed passion, and bowling his side to victory at Bridgetown and Kingston. His bowling fell away after that, and the emergence of a number of younger, quicker bowlers meant that Dillon's place was no longer secure. He was left out after the series in South Africa in 2003-04, but made it into the Champions Trophy squad, and took a career-best 5 for 29 against Bangladesh at the Rose Bowl, although injury ruled him out of the rest of the tournament.

After impressive performances as a top-order batsman for the Barbados Under-19 side, he was named vice-captain of West Indies Under-19s for the 2004 Youth World Cup. Two years later he made his first-class debut but had to wait till 2009 before hitting his maiden first-class hundred, against Windward Islands in Bridgetown.

Spotted in the nets by Brian Lara, he was called up for his Test debut after just one match for Barbados, and promptly took five wickets against Sri Lanka in Jamaica in June 2003. He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a protégé of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins. He bowls fast, can swing the ball and get reverse swing, but insists that he does not go for out-and-out pace.  \n"", ""Despite regular chances at Test level, however, he rarely showed enough control to be a match-winner and the selectors blew as hot and cold as did his bowling.  They did draft him into the squad to tour England in 2007. He bowled well in the Chester-le-Street Test but was fined for swearing too loudly, and an unproductive series in South Africa followed. He lost his spot for the first Test against Sri Lanka, was recalled in Trinidad and grabbed five wickets to help West Indies draw the series. At one-day level he was given a long run in 2006 but axed towards the end of the year after failing to shine at the Champions Trophy. Edwards was not needed at the World Cup but, on his ODI recall, he blasted through England with 5 for 45 at Lord's."", ""He reached a personal milestone in the second Test against New Zealand at Napier on West Indies' 2008-09 tour, taking 7 for 87 - his career-best figures - to pass 100 Test dismissals. Settling into the role of senior bowler in the West Indies side, he bowled aggressively without much reward on England's tour of West Indies in early 2009, and was particularly venomous towards Kevin Pietersen and James Anderson. But arguably his most important performances in the series came with the bat, as he and Daren Powell clung on for 60 balls to secure a draw in the third Test in Antigua. Edwards was at it again in the fifth Test in Trinidad, surviving a tense finale to secure the Wisden Trophy for the first time since 2000."", ""But just as Edwards began to find the consistency that had long eluded him, he picked up another back injury in the course of West Indies' campaign at the World Twenty20 in England in June 2009. He returned to Barbados and was put on a remedial programme, but abandoned it to represent Deccan Chargers in the Champions League later that year. He picked up another injury in the course of that tournament, and was ruled out of West Indies' tour of Australia - perhaps a relief as the depleted side failed to win a single game. The last of his 55 Tests came against Bangladesh in Khulna in 2012."", 'Hampshire benefited from his presence in 2015. By picking up 45 Championship wickets at 20.8 from eight matches, he was the prime force in their First Division survival, taking 10 wickets in a first-class match for only the second in his career as Hampshire crucially beat Nottinghamshire in the last match to avoid relegation. A broken ankle suffered in a pre-match warm-up at Headingley wrecked his 2016 season as Hampshire only escaped relegation because Durham were demoted after a financial bale-out, but a useful season a year later again helped Hampshire escape on the final day.

He toured England in 1995, playing in the Lord's Test, and won a second cap when drafted into the West Indies side as emergency cover during their ill-fated tour of South Africa in 1998-99.  His nomadic career took him to Glamorgan, Staffordshire, and three South African provincial sides. Frustrated by niggling injuries, he took up coaching and found work with the ECB before returning to the game with Leicestershire in 2004. He added one final side to his CV when he moved to Durham in 2006 to enjoy one of his most successful seasons, and his career-best 155 in the final match of the summer helped keep his team in the top flight.

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers. And in this era of Twenty20 cricket, Gayle is the batsman who has thrived like no other. \n', ""Among his many strengths, perhaps the biggest one is his outstanding hand-eye coordination, which allows Gayle to regularly hit even good-length deliveries for boundaries. Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary. "", 'Over two seasons - 2011 and 2012 - of the IPL, he became easily the most feared batsman of the league, smashing more hundreds and sixes than any other batsman, by far. When he carted Pune Warriors all over the ground to score an unbeaten 175 in IPL 2013, it felt right that he should finally own the record for highest individual score, fastest century, and most sixes in a Twenty20 innings, because no batsman has dominated Twenty20 cricket like he has. ', ""Gayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods."", ""And then there is also his brisk non-turning offspin, with which he has turned himself into a genuine allrounder in limited-overs cricket. His tendency to stay aloof on the field sometimes suggests he isn't interested in the proceedings, but his relaxed approached was good for the team whenever he led West Indies. However, West Indies have missed his services far too often due his differences with their board. During his exile, he was a Twenty20 regular in various leagues around the world, entertaining crowds in Australia, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. After a long spell out from international cricket he returned strongly in 2012 on the tour of England and subsequently at home against New Zealand.""]",[],103.0,182,11,7214,333,42.18,11970,60.26,15,37,1046,98,96.0,0.0,289.0,283,17,10151,215,38.16,11649,87.14,25,51,1093,314,120.0,0.0,58.0,54,4,1627,117,32.54,1139,142.84,2,13,138,105,15.0,0.0,180.0,321,26,13226,333,44.83,,,32,64,,,158.0,0.0,361.0,354,24,12860,215,38.96,,,29,67,,,150.0,0.0,371.0,363,47,12318,175*,38.98,8374,147.09,21,76,942,907,87.0,0.0,103.0,104,7109,3120,73,May-34,Jun-81,42.73,2.63,97.3,2,2,0,289.0,195,7334,5846,165,May-46,May-46,35.43,4.78,44.4,3,1,0,58.0,23,319,377,17,Feb-15,Feb-15,22.17,7.09,18.7,0,0,0,180.0,,12511,5194,132,May-34,,39.34,2.49,94.7,,2,0,361.0,,9610,7300,227,May-46,May-46,32.15,4.55,42.3,4,1,0,371.0,131,1945,2479,80,Apr-22,Apr-22,30.98,7.64,24.3,2,0,0

It wasn't until his fourth coming as an international cricketer that he really made his mark, with back-to-back centuries against the mighty Australians. All of a sudden, his phlegmatic approach became a vital counterpoint to a rejunevated Brian Lara at the other end. But his form fell away and he was dropped after the first Test against South Africa in April 2004-05. Recalled for the 2005-06 tour to New Zealand, he was the second highest run scorer in the three-Test fixture. He looked good for a third hundred - and West Indies for a rare victory - in the first Test at Auckland, but a rash stroke on 95 ruined all that and Ganga was in for flack from his critics. Indifferent innings at Wellington and Napier notwithstanding, he was retained for the series against India later that season. It proved to be a benchmark of sorts, and Ganga clearly had taken a mature step forward. His total of 344 runs in four Tests was a team high by some margin, and his 135 and unbeaten 66 in the drawn third Test in St Kitts were innings of confidence and composure.  He cemented his place with back-to-back 80s in Pakistan. Touring England as the vice-captain, Ganga's position was soon elevated following Ramnaresh Sarwan's injury. Ganga, however, failed to shine with the bat and was dropped for the Natwest Series that followed. Even after being named as Trinidad & Tobago's cricketer of the year, Ganga failed to find a place in the squad for the ICC World Twenty20 and the tour of Zimbabwe before making a return to the squad for the the tour of South Africa that followed. However he had six poor innings in South Africa and was not picked by the selectors for the rest of 2008 and the majority of 2009. He continued to lead Trinidad and Tobago, and their victory in the Stanford 20/20 won them a berth in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 in India, where Ganga's stock went up when he guided his team to the final.\n"", ' October 2009\n \n']",[],48.0,86,2,2160,135,25.71,5556,38.87,3,9,284,2,30.0,0.0,35.0,34,1,843,71,25.54,1414,59.61,0,9,69,7,11.0,0.0,1.0,1,0,26,26,26,31,83.87,0,0,3,1,0.0,0.0,172.0,302,29,10137,265,37.13,,,23,48,,,112.0,0.0,109.0,108,13,2810,101*,29.57,,,2,20,,,36.0,0.0,40.0,31,5,518,62*,19.92,476,108.82,0,1,27,19,14.0,0.0,48.0,8,186,106,1,Jan-20,Jan-20,106,3.41,186,0,0,0,35.0,1,1,4,0,-,-,-,24,-,0,0,0,1.0,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,172.0,,622,334,4,01-Jul,,83.5,3.22,155.5,,0,0,109.0,,301,193,5,Feb-20,Feb-20,38.6,3.84,60.2,0,0,0,40.0,1,6,18,0,-,-,-,18,-,0,0,0

1.73 m ",,Middle-order batsman,Left-hand bat,Left-arm medium,,,,"['\nBrendan Nash was an inspired acquisition by Kent ahead of the 2012 season.  His three summers with the club have yielded not too far short of 3,000 first class runs in a style that identified him as one of the more sober, reliable run-makers on the county circuit.  His best season was 2013 when he accumulated five centuries, including 199 not out in a successful run chase against Gloucestershire. The end of that innings was notable with Nash having to retire hurt, with victory 21 runs away, one run short of a double century because of sunstroke after spending more than five hours at the crease. He said he was dizzy and had slightly blurred vision and felt like a boxer on the ropes, liable to be hit at any minute. Kent batsman Brendan Nash says he had no choice but to retire hurt against Gloucestershire on Saturday, despite being a run short of a double century.  \n', ""Born in Western Australia and with a Jamaican father, Nash stamped himself as a first-class player of real promise for Queensland with innings of 157 against South Australia and 96 in the Pura Cup final win over Tasmania in 2001-02. He followed up those contributions the next season with 176 against New South Wales before a form slump disrupted his progress. He fought back to earn Bulls' contract status and was a regular performer without nailing a permanent place. A left-handed batsman, a stunning fielder (he was a Test substitute against West Indies at the Gabba in 2005) and a useful left-arm medium-pacer, he played five Pura Cup games in 2005-06 and picked up the third century of his career with 107 at the WACA. "", 'Small at 173cm, Nash follows in the sporting trail of his father, who was a swimmer for Jamaica at Olympic and Commonwealth Games level from 1966 to 1970. After being used only three times in 2006-07, he was not offered a contract and decided to try his luck in Jamaica. He had a strong first campaign, which finished with him scoring a match-winning century in the Carib Challenge final, and after barely 12 months in the Caribbean he was called into the West Indies squad for the ODI tri-series in Canada. A Test promotion also came quickly and he made 23 on debut in the rain-ruined match against New Zealand in Dunedin before a satisfying double of 74 and 65 in Napier. A central contract soon followed and during the Tests against England in the Caribbean Nash provided a buffer between the powerhouses of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan and a previously fallible lower order. His sensible batting earned him 239 runs, including a maiden Test century.', 'When Nash was appointed vice-captain towards the end of 2010 it looked as though his future was secure. Not so.  A poor run of form saw him dropped after a home Test against India in 2011, however, and a year later he was left to concentrate on forging a county career with Kent.']",[],21.0,33,0,1103,114,33.42,2548,43.28,2,8,130,3,6.0,0.0,9.0,7,3,104,39*,26,141,73.75,0,0,11,1,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,139.0,229,30,7752,207,38.95,,,18,32,,,50.0,0.0,88.0,66,16,1596,98*,31.92,,,0,8,,,28.0,0.0,8.0,6,1,84,26,16.8,96,87.5,0,0,7,0,1.0,0.0,21.0,14,492,247,2,Jan-21,Jan-21,123.5,3.01,246,0,0,0,9.0,6,294,224,5,Mar-56,Mar-56,44.8,4.57,58.8,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,139.0,,1657,801,23,02-Jul,,34.82,2.9,72,0,0,0,88.0,,798,562,16,Apr-20,Apr-20,35.12,4.22,49.8,1,0,0,8.0,2,24,40,1,Jan-32,Jan-32,40,10,24,0,0,0

But it was in India that his career began to take a nosedive. He was called for a suspect action in back-to-back matches in the CLT20 2014 and was subsequently banned from playing the final in Bangalore. He was withdrawn from the West Indies squad, who were due to play the hosts in a limited-overs series of five ODIs and a T20 in October that year. Then he withdrew himself from the squad named for the 2015 World Cup, citing the need to keep working on his bowling action.', '\n', '\nNarine was lost to international cricket for over a year, but he returned to the West Indies side in November 2015 and ran into trouble with his action again.

There were plenty of explosive T20 finishes as well, including a 15-ball 38 that put the 2012 World T20 semi-final well beyond Australia's reach."", ""\nBut through it all, the canvas of franchise cricket remained the best medium to showcase the hulking Pollard's unbridled hitting - with his top hand frequently slipping off the bat handle even as the ball disappeared far over wide long-on - and canny medium-pace.

His axing - along with Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo - came soon after West Indies pulled out of their tour of India with an ODI, a T20 and three Tests still remaining, due to a dispute with the board and the players' association over payment structures.

That both titles came in the T20 format defines the kind of cricketer he is. A batsman who hits the ball hard enough to make the inanimate thing scream for mercy, he functions primarily as a finisher. He generates even more pace with the ball in hand and when it is anywhere near him in the field, it doesn't matter at what pace it's travelling. Russell will probably get to it. He is less a cricketer, in the traditional sense, than an athlete.  \n"", ""An allrounder from Jamaica, Russell made his first-class debut at the age of 19. He made his way into the West Indies A squad and captured plenty of attention with his exploits in a 50-over game against Ireland in June 2010, smashing 61 off 34 balls and taking 6 for 42. It was a performance that helped him win a place in West Indies' 2011 World Cup squad. Things didn't go to plan there, but his capabilities were on show against the newly-crowned champions India in June when he came out at No. 9, with the score at 96 for 7, and smashed 92 off 64 balls. "", 'Russell\'s impact in international cricket was a bit sporadic until 2015, against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, when he provided a consolation victory for West Indies on a difficult tour by hitting 64 off 40 balls to chase down 263 with one wicket to spare. ""My thing,"" is how he described batting in the slog overs. ""I think I really enjoy when there\'s five overs or ten overs left."" ', ""Those skills were evident in domestic T20 cricket though. He had a fine season with Worcestershire at the Friends Life t20 in England in July 2013 and a ground-breaking Caribbean Premier League a month later when his team Jamaica Tallawahs became champions. Russell's star shone brightest at the IPL 2015, when he was named Man of the Series, and the Big Bash League 2015-16 when he struck at 186.86 and picked up 16 wickets - joint-second best - from 10 matches. He won the CPL title with Tallawahs in 2013, the IPL title with Kolkata Knight Riders in 2014, the Bangladesh Premier League title with Comilla Victorians, the BBL title with Sydney Thunder and the Pakistan Super League title with Islamabad United in 2016. "", 'His flamboyant style is a part of his personality as well, which became apparent as he unveiled a hairstyle similar to Mr T at the 2015 World Cup. A year later, with his mohawk dyed blonde, Russell applied the final touches to a mauling of hosts India in the World T20 semi-final as West Indies became the first team to win the trophy twice.', 'During the most successful period of his T20 career, however, a cloud hung over Russell because the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission had charged him for not filing his whereabouts clause three times in 2015, an offence tantamount to one failed dope test. After hearings that went on over a year, Russell was found guilty of a whereabouts-clause violation and banned for one year by an independent doping panel in Jamaica. The ban was from January 31, 2017, until January 30, 2018.']",[],1.0,1,0,2,2,2,9,22.22,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,52.0,44,9,998,92*,28.51,765,130.45,0,4,91,54,11.0,0.0,47.0,39,13,465,47,17.88,329,141.33,0,0,30,32,11.0,0.0,17.0,24,1,609,128,26.47,,,2,0,,,6.0,0.0,89.0,75,18,1917,132*,33.63,,,2,8,,,22.0,0.0,287.0,239,58,4456,121*,24.61,2675,166.57,2,13,304,333,134.0,0.0,1.0,2,138,104,1,Jan-73,1/104,104,4.52,138,0,0,0,52.0,51,2176,2128,65,Apr-35,Apr-35,32.73,5.86,33.4,5,0,0,47.0,40,595,908,25,02-Oct,02-Oct,36.32,9.15,23.8,0,0,0,17.0,31,2083,1104,54,May-36,Sep-78,20.44,3.18,38.5,4,3,0,89.0,86,3663,3317,126,Jun-28,Jun-28,26.32,5.43,29,5,4,0,287.0,267,4896,6677,259,04-Nov,04-Nov,25.77,8.18,18.9,7,0,0

Consistently bowling at around 150kph, he hurried most of the Australian batsmen and made the headlines in the Perth Test, forcing Ricky Ponting to retire hurt after hitting him on the elbow with a pacy 146kph delivery. In the 2010 IPL auction, he was bought by Deccan Chargers for a healthy sum of $720,000, but it's in the longer format that he holds the greatest promise, a fact that was confirmed by his ten-wicket haul in two Tests in Sri Lanka in 2010-11.

An ankle injury suffered during the Centurion Test in December 2014, however, slowed him down - in both senses of the term. Significantly down on pace after his recovery and return, he took just nine wickets in eight Tests that included a tour of England, and home and away series against Australia. He was left out ahead of the 2016 home Tests against India. Having to prove himself all over again in domestic cricket, Roach took 23 wickets at 16.17 in the 2016-17 Professional Cricket League, and was back in West Indies' Test squad for their 2017 tour of England.""]",['Lord Gavron Award - 2006'],53.0,85,17,827,41,12.16,2162,38.25,0,0,99,4,12.0,0.0,80.0,52,32,276,34,13.8,515,53.59,0,0,21,5,18.0,0.0,11.0,1,1,3,3*,-,2,150,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,108.0,149,30,1568,53,13.17,,,0,3,,,33.0,0.0,104.0,66,40,368,34,14.15,,,0,0,,,23.0,0.0,46.0,13,5,59,12,7.37,52,113.46,0,0,3,3,18.0,0.0,53.0,94,9438,5000,184,Jun-48,10/146,27.17,3.17,51.2,11,9,1,80.0,79,3967,3312,114,Jun-27,Jun-27,29.05,5,34.7,3,3,0,11.0,11,234,284,10,Feb-25,Feb-25,28.4,7.28,23.4,0,0,0,108.0,188,16458,8979,333,Jul-23,10/146,26.96,3.27,49.4,19,13,1,104.0,102,4931,4060,145,Jun-27,Jun-27,28,4.94,34,4,3,0,46.0,44,912,1229,28,Mar-18,Mar-18,43.89,8.08,32.5,0,0,0

He was also the first player to hit six sixes in an over in a first-class game ","['\nA cricketing genius, Garry Sobers excelled at all aspects of the game, and few would argue his claim as the finest allround player in modern cricket. His exceptional Test batting average tells little about the manner in which he made the runs, his elegant yet powerful style marked by all the shots, but memorably his off-side play. As a batsman he was great, as a bowler, merely superb, but would have made the West Indies side as a bowler alone. He was remarkably versatile with the ball, bowling two styles of spin - left-arm orthodox and wrist spin, but was also a fine fast-medium opening bowler. His catching close to the wicket may have been equalled but never surpassed, and he was a brilliant fielder anywhere. He was an enterprising captain - at times maybe too enterprising, as when a generous declaration allowed England to win a decisive match at Port-of-Spain.  Born with an extra finger on each hand (removed at birth), Sobers excelled at most athletic activities, playing golf, soccer and bastketball for Barbados, and made his first class debut at the age of 16, appearing in Tests a year later. He was played initially mostly as a bowler, but four years later set the Test record for an individual batsman with a mammoth 365 against Pakistan. His achievments are numerous - including the six consecutive sixes hit off an over from the unfortunate Malcolm Nash, a superb innings of 254 for the Rest of the World against Australia in 1971 that earned the praise of Don Bradman, and much more. Like many West Indians, he plied his trade abroad, playing for Nottinghamshire, and South Australia.

In his first Test, against Australia, Smith scored a blazing 62 in a losing cause, but failed to score in the next Test. A good eye compensates for his lack of footwork and throughout the series he showed promise, but it wasn't enough, and he was dropped to smooth off the rough edges. In 2004, he was selected to open against England, and he immediately pulled his team out of a hole with a stroke-filled century. But just as he began to settle into a groove, a freak net injury left him with a fractured thumb, and he missed the next two Tests. He was axed after another failure in the Test series against Australia in 2005-06 and spent two years in the wilderness. He returned to play in the one-dayers against India in 2006-07 and was picked for the World Cup squad where his form was solid rather than spectacular.

All that changed, however, on the final day of the third Test at Newlands, where he brought the calypso back to Caribbean cricket with a wonderful debut century. Smith had been given a surprise opportunity - ahead of his Grenadian namesake Devon - when Marlon Samuels flew home with a knee injury.

While he has only managed a brief and disappointing Test career, he has shown his value as a limited-overs player for West Indies, particularly in the shortest format, and has also forged a successful career for various franchises around the world including Mumbai Indians, Brisbane Heat and Karachi Kings. ', ' \n', ' \nSimmons, the nephew of the former West Indies allrounder Phil, was handed his international debut in late 2006, during an ODI series in Pakistan, and scored 70 in his second match. It was to be his only half-century in his first nine international innings, however, and he was soon left out of the side. ', ' \nHe returned in March 2009, this time making his Test debut, having forced his way back by scoring 282 in a first-class game for West Indies A against the touring England XI. His returns, however, were poor: the last of the eight Tests he has played so far came in October 2011, and his 16 innings have only yielded a highest score of 49. ', "" \nBut he has enjoyed happier times in the limited-overs formats. ODI highlights include the 792 runs he scored in 2011, at 49.50, including a maiden century and eight fifties, and the start he enjoyed to the 2015 World Cup, with an 84-ball 102 against Ireland followed by a 46-ball 50 against Pakistan. In T20Is, he has been a frequent source of brisk runs anywhere in the top four. He has been one of the most consistent overseas players in the IPL, and topped Mumbai's run-charts with 540 runs at 45.00, helping the team clinch the IPL title in 2015. "", "" \nSimmons played a brief but vital role in West Indies' title run at the 2016 World T20. Initially ruled out of the tournament with a back injury, he got his chance thanks to a hamstring injury suffered by Andre Fletcher just before the semi-finals. Having arrived in the country only a day-and-a-half earlier, he scored an unbeaten 51-ball 82 at the Wankhede Stadium - his home ground in the IPL - to make short work of India's total of 192 and steer West Indies into the final.

After his first Test innings, 84 not out against Pakistan, Ted Dexter was moved to predict a Test average of more than 50 - quite a millstone to hang around any young player's neck. But on his first tour, to England in 2000, Sarwan lived up to the hype by topping the averages. His footwork, which seemed to require no early trigger movements, was strikingly confident and precise. \n"", ""It was a surprise when he then produced a horror run of three runs in five innings in Australia, but against India in 2001-02 he was back to his composed best. Sarwan, who took over as Brian Lara's vice-captain in March 2003, required 28 matches and 49 innings to post his maiden Test century - 119 in December 2002 - and even then it came against the less-than-mighty Bangladeshis. As the likes of Graham Gooch and Steve Waugh can testify, the first time is often the hardest. "", 'A dream series against South Africa in 2003-04, where he averaged nearly 100 runs a Test, was followed by a lean run against England. But he returned to form in a stunning manner with an unbeaten 261 against Bangladesh in June. Then came an England tour in 2004 where he began and ended the tour on a low note, but was prolific in the middle. However, West Indian fortunes were on the ascendancy in one-dayers, as they reached the finals of the NatWest Series and then won the ICC Champions Trophy with Sarwan playing a big hand in both tournaments. ', 'Sarwan was one of the players involved in a contract dispute with WICB and missed the first Test against South Africa in 2005. On his return he scored attractive runs, but was again overlooked for the captaincy when it was handed back to Brian Lara. ', ""He didn't fare well with the bat in the 2006-07 season, averaging just 25.90 in 13 games he played till the end of the Champions Trophy. It was still a shock when he was dropped from the second Test against Pakistan in the away series in November. He returned for the third Test and sustained a foot injury which kept him out of the one-dayers against Pakistan and the tour of India."", ""Finally, the West Indies captaincy came his way following Lara's retirement. It wasn't exactly a field full of promising candidates as West Indies cricket yearned for true leadership. Injuries limited his appearances in 2007, and a friendly captaincy competition between Sarwan and Gayle continued with both players publicly supporting one another. Sarwan was Gayle's deputy on his return to the side in 2008 for the home series against Sri Lanka but the demotion did not affect his output, and he made three half-centuries and a hundred in the two Tests."", 'In the 2009 home series against England, Sarwan recorded his personal best of 291 in the first innings of the fourth Test, equalling the highest score for the West Indies made by Sir Vivian Richards. He scored his 15th Test century against England at Chester-le-Street in May of the same year but West Indies lost the series 2-0. ', 'The following year, Sarwan lost his central contract in 2010, subsequently winning damages from the West Indies Cricket Board over comments made about his attitude and fitness. He played his last Test against India in Bridgetown in July 2011. ', ""Having fallen out of international favour, he signed for English county Leicestershire for the 2012 English season and enjoyed noteworthy success in a struggling side, scoring two centuries in the Championship, another two in 40-over matches and falling short of 1,000 first-class runs largely because injury caused him to miss two matches.  He agreed to return as four-day captain in 2013 but played only half the season because of injury and West Indies' limited-overs commitments."", 'West Indies recalled him for the first time in 18 months for the limited overs side that toured Australia in early 2013, although it was an inauspicious return.

When he started his Test career at 19, without yet representing his native Jamaica in a first-class match, his composure and skill prompted comparisons - quite unfairly - with Viv Richards. His technique was near to faultless, and he exudes a bull-headed confidence - he used to skip his schoolwork on the basis that exams were irrelevant to future Test cricketers. \n', ""However, that confidence, which often overflowed into perceived arrogance, has landed him in plenty of trouble. It almost got him sent home from India late in 2002 after he defied a team curfew - but he was kept on, and responded with his a disciplined maiden Test century in Kolkata. His lack of consistency meant he remained an irregular member of the team in the 2000s, but just before his selection for the 2007 World Cup, he was drawn into a major controversy after Nagpur police alleged that he passed on match-related information to an alleged bookie ahead of an ODI against India. He was included in the World Cup squad despite the ICC's investigations into the issue, where he only briefly shone, ending the tournament by running out Brian Lara in his last international innings."", 'He was called for the World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, but the match-fixing allegations reared its head in 2008 when he was found guilty of ""receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute."" Samuels was subsequently banned for two years, at a time when West Indies desperately needed solidity in their middle-order. He returned to the West Indies Test and ODI teams in 2011, but it was only on the tour to England in 2012 that he finally showed what he was capable of. Against a top-class bowling attack in difficult conditions, Samuels scored 386 runs in five innings, with a century and three fifties, defying the England bowlers every time with his correct technique and classy strokeplay. Later that year came a highlight of his career: a gutsy, snappy 78 in the World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, which lifted West Indies out of a hole and to their first world title since the 1979 World Cup.', ""A month after the World T20 triumph, Samuels notched up his first Test double-century, scoring 260 against Bangladesh in Khulna. Consistency eluded him, however, as the big scores were often followed by dips in form and injuries. A facial injury suffered during the Big Bash League in January 2013 ruled him out of West Indies' limited-overs tour to Australia. He picked up a four-for on his return to international cricket against Zimbabwe but his batting form did not improve. Samuels scored just two international hundreds, both in ODIs, in the two seasons following the double-hundred and his lack of form in Tests, and competitions like the World T20, only contributed further to West Indies' struggles. As a result of his poor form, he was dropped after just one Test in the home series against New Zealand in June 2014.
